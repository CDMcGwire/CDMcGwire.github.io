Not used frequently but willing to use more\r\n- Bash/\\*nix CLI - Frequent professional use\r\n- SQL - Never a focus but used frequently professionally\r\n- Python - Some experience from scattered projects\r\n- Rust - Dabbling in with an interest in professional use\r\n\r\n<!-- TODO: Put more emphasis on things I've built with the following technologies. -->\r\n\r\n### Linux Based Systems\r\n\r\nThe primary _target_ platform of my professional development work. Aware of many\r\nof its common concerns and very comfortable navigating and writing scripts for\r\nits shell based Command Line Interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Windows Based Systems\r\n\r\nThe platform I do most of my local testing, development, and day to day tasks\r\non. Not as familiar with some of the core SDK libraries as I would like to be.\r\n\r\n### Apache Camel - Integration and Routing Framework\r\n\r\nLeveraged Camel to implement message routing and transformation systems. Also\r\nused the library to host REST APIs for internal support tooling. Familiar with\r\nits core architecture and most of its common features.\r\n\r\n### Angular - JavaScript Framework\r\n\r\nUsed in my professional work to build web based UIs for internal tooling.\r\nFamiliar with its core structure and concepts. Still learning its limits and\r\nbest practice.\r\n\r\n### Vue - JavaScript Framework\r\n\r\nUsed in my personal web development projects. Learned in tandem with Angular to\r\nget a better sense of the strengths and weaknesses of both and a better\r\nunderstanding of modern web dev as a whole.\r\n\r\n### Maven - JVM Based Build Tool\r\n\r\nSetup many, many project build schemes using Maven. Mostly for Java based\r\nprojects, as was intended. Sometimes also for very much not Java based projects,\r\nas was probably not intended, but was stable and reliable enough. ðŸ˜€\r\n\r\nExperienced with integrating into other CI systems, like remote build servers,\r\nunit test frameworks, and artifactories.\r\n\r\n### Spring Framework - JVM Application Framework\r\n\r\nBuilt and managed several production applications using Spring's dependency\r\ninjection, repository management, and web server features. Also toyed with its\r\nmore recent Reactive Web library to create responsive services.\r\n\r\n### Unity 3D - Game Engine\r\n\r\nPrimary development tool for hobby projects. Very familiar with its .NET based\r\nscripting API and through that the many concerns involved with developing\r\nrealtime, high performance applications. As well the benefits and tradeoffs of\r\nthe different methods of inter-system communication.\r\n\r\n","subtext":"Computer Scientist and Software Engineer.","headings":[{"depth":2,"value":"Background","anchor":"#background"},{"depth":3,"value":"Brown Brother's Harriman - Infomediary Team","anchor":"#brown-brothers-harriman---infomediary-team"},{"depth":3,"value":"University of Washington - Bothell Campus","anchor":"#university-of-washington---bothell-campus"},{"depth":3,"value":"Coding With Kids","anchor":"#coding-with-kids"},{"depth":3,"value":"Game Development Hobby","anchor":"#game-development-hobby"},{"depth":2,"value":"Proficiencies","anchor":"#proficiencies"},{"depth":3,"value":"Programming Languages","anchor":"#programming-languages"},{"depth":3,"value":"Linux Based Systems","anchor":"#linux-based-systems"},{"depth":3,"value":"Windows Based Systems","anchor":"#windows-based-systems"},{"depth":3,"value":"Apache Camel - Integration and Routing Framework","anchor":"#apache-camel---integration-and-routing-framework"},{"depth":3,"value":"Angular - JavaScript Framework","anchor":"#angular---javascript-framework"},{"depth":3,"value":"Vue - JavaScript Framework","anchor":"#vue---javascript-framework"},{"depth":3,"value":"Maven - JVM Based Build Tool","anchor":"#maven---jvm-based-build-tool"},{"depth":3,"value":"Spring Framework - JVM Application Framework","anchor":"#spring-framework---jvm-application-framework"},{"depth":3,"value":"Unity 3D - Game Engine","anchor":"#unity-3d---game-engine"}]}},"context":{}}
