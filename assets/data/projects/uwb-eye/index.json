I had the\r\nopportunity to work with the EYE Center (Educating Young Eyes) on research into\r\nnovel computer use for diagnosing and treating near vision issues\r\n\r\nThe student research team was led by Bill Erdly of the University of Washington.\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nOf particular interest, at the time of my involvement, was exploring how digital\r\ngames could be leveraged for near vision assessment, improvement, and\r\nrehabilitation for children.\r\n\r\n## Role\r\n\r\nI served as a Software Engineer on the project and was responsible for turning\r\nprototyped game concepts into functional builds. Due to the experimental nature\r\nof the domain, emphasis was put into ensuring that the application was flexible\r\nand ready for modification.\r\n\r\nOccasionally I would also serve as a technical advisor to other members of the\r\nteam on general Android app development and frontend web technologies.\r\n","subtext":"","headings":[{"depth":2,"value":"Goal","anchor":"#goal"},{"depth":2,"value":"Role","anchor":"#role"}]}},"context":{}}
