I had the\r\nopportunity to work with the\r\n[EYE Center (Educating Young Eyes)](http://educatingyoungeyes.org/index.php) on\r\nresearch into novel computer use for diagnosing and treating near vision issues\r\n\r\nThe student research team was led by\r\n[Bill Erdly of the University of Washington](https://www.uwb.edu/css/faculty/bios/werdly),\r\nwith assistance from\r\n[Dr. Alan Pearson of Vision Clinics of Development and Learning](http://www.visioncdl.com/about_doctors.php).\r\n\r\n## The EYE Center\r\n\r\nThe overarching purpose of the research was to determine what new roles\r\ntechnology could play in helping diagnose and correct children's near vision\r\nissues.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Pearson and many of his colleagues, untreated near vision\r\nissues often have a massive negative effect on a child's ability to learn. This\r\nis especially true if they are already dealing with learning disabilities like\r\nDyslexia.\r\n\r\n> If you're interested, you can find more information on the topic on the\r\n> Research page of\r\n> [Well Child Vision](http://www.wellchildvision.org/documents.php)\r\n\r\nResearch at the time estimated that, out of one million students, 25% have\r\nvision issues. The (at the time) standard distance and near acuity screening\r\ngiven to those kids is able to detect myopia (nearsightedness) and amblyopia\r\n(lazy eye). However, it is unable to detect the 130,000 who would have hyperopia\r\n(farsightedness), 30,000 with strabismus (eye turn), or th 50,000 with\r\nconvergence insufficiency (inability to focus both eyes on the same point).\r\n\r\nClearly then, there was a gap in standard vision screening that needed to be\r\naddressed. A gap that we suspected could be filled much more efficiently and\r\nthoroughly with the assistance of digital technology.\r\n\r\n## Role\r\n\r\nMy role in the project was as a Software Developer. By the time I joined, the\r\ngroup already had several ideas for video games that they hoped students could\r\nplay both as part of the vision screening process and as a regular activity for\r\nvision therapy. Some of the ideas already had rudimentary prototypes, however,\r\nthese prototypes needed a good deal more work to be usable for study.\r\n\r\nIn addition to refining the prototype games, I also assisted in the creation of\r\nsupport tooling, such as a \"library\" application that would manage installed\r\ntrial applications and aid volunteers and patients in accessing them.\r\n\r\n## Games for Research\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent concerns with realizing the game prototypes into\r\nusable tools was ensuring that the they could be rapidly tweaked and modified to\r\nkeep pace with the needs of the researchers that would be using them for study.\r\n\r\n> âš  This article is still a work in progress.\r\n\r\n<!-- Up next: talking about the game I made. Getting pictures in. Commenting on\r\ndesign decisions and lessons learned. Would be best to focus on the decisions I\r\nmade to make it expandable rather than trying to comment on how I think it\r\nwould do in the real world, since we never got that far. -->\r\n","subtext":"","organization":"UW Bothell","start":"January 2017","end":"June 2017","headings":[{"depth":2,"value":"The EYE Center","anchor":"#the-eye-center"},{"depth":2,"value":"Role","anchor":"#role"},{"depth":2,"value":"Games for Research","anchor":"#games-for-research"}]}},"context":{}}
