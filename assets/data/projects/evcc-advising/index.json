At the time, they were\r\nresponsible for handling most of the student body's mandatory degree advising.\r\n\r\nThis was particularly an issue for the smaller departments (such as the CS\r\ndivision, which had one dedicated faculty member at the time), who would receive\r\na drastic increase in workload during registration periods.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the project was cleaning up course information\r\ninconsistancies. When the project began, a large amount of course information\r\nwas still recorded manually on Word documents. In many cases this led to issues\r\nwith communicating course prerequisites to students, as there were no enforced\r\nstandards as to how to record this information.\r\n\r\nThis was included as an aspect of the project due to our dependency on that\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we designed a web based system that would allow students\r\nto generate a potential course schedule based on information they provide. The\r\nsystem would access a database of available courses and prerequisite\r\ndependencies in order to determine what courses the student needed for the\r\ndesired degree, and would suggest a timeline.\r\n\r\nThis is not enough to completely replace in-person advising, but it would handle\r\na large number of smaller cases, and would give the advisor meetings a better\r\nstarting point.\r\n\r\n### Role\r\n\r\nI served as project manager for the club during my time at Everett, and was\r\nresponsible for facilitating communications between project teams. I also\r\nparticpated in high level design, prototyped front-end web systems, and\r\nparticipated in database development.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nI got started with the project shortly after I began pursuing an education in\r\nSoftware Engineering. As such, this was my introduction to many professional\r\ndevelopment tools and the development process in general.\r\n\r\nTechnology-wise, I learned the basics of having a web application communicate\r\nwith a database. I prototyped a login system, and began work on storing and\r\naccessing course information in a database.\r\n\r\nThe project was also a great lesson on working with other developers of various\r\nskill levels. One of the largest hurdles to the project was communication. While\r\nthe 1-3 hour long club meetings were very productive, at home progress was very\r\nslow. Due in part to it being a side project for everyone, but there was also a\r\nlack of understanding of individual responsibilities.\r\n\r\nMy early attempts at coordination were by email, which proved to be\r\nunsuccessful. The issue was that most of the members of the team had very little\r\nneed for email otherwise and were not used to checking it. More modern forms of\r\ncommunication, such as Skype, proved more successful.\r\n\r\nThe biggest lesson in project management was ensuring that every member had\r\nclear short term goals. Without short-term goals, members will often retread old\r\nground or lack the motivation to work on the project at all. While it's\r\ndifficult to establish a long term timeline when working without prior\r\nexperience, setting up weekly tasks and deliverables during club meetings could\r\nbe accomplished after some talking.\r\n","subtext":"","headings":[{"depth":3,"value":"Goal","anchor":"#goal"},{"depth":3,"value":"Proposal","anchor":"#proposal"},{"depth":3,"value":"Role","anchor":"#role"},{"depth":3,"value":"Results","anchor":"#results"}]}},"context":{}}
