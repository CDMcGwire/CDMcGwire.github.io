The course serves as an introductory lesson for\r\ngraduate students, with hopes of sparking further interest and development in\r\nHPC.\r\n\r\nThe two main points of interest for the research were:\r\n\r\n- Determing what expectations should be set when non-specific instructions are\r\n  given to students.\r\n- Further develop methods for introducing the knowledge of industry experts to\r\n  students of vastly different mindsets.\r\n\r\n## Role\r\n\r\nComing from no background in HPC, my role in the research was two-fold; learn as\r\nmuch of the subject as I could to develop intoductory curriculum resources and\r\nevaluate proposed lessons and resources from the perspective of a new student.\r\n\r\nIt was imperitive that I record my experiences when learning the material\r\nmyself, so that potential learning hurdles could be identified early on. To that\r\nend I created a series of documents that walked through what I learned while\r\ndescribing the sections in which difficulties were faced, what made it\r\ndifficult, and how I got through that hurdle.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nThrough my participation I gained a solid understanding of the core principles\r\nof parallel computing and how to program for devices built to take advantage of\r\na high level of parallelization.\r\n\r\nTechnology-wise, I became familiar specifically with developing in an NVIDIA\r\nCUDA environment on Linux for general purpose programming of Graphics Processing\r\nUnits. Many concepts used are, however, portable to other systems. Such as the\r\nhigh level architecture of a GPU and the resource needs and limitations of that\r\nstyle of programming.\r\n","subtext":"","headings":[{"depth":2,"value":"Goal","anchor":"#goal"},{"depth":2,"value":"Role","anchor":"#role"},{"depth":2,"value":"Results","anchor":"#results"}]}},"context":{}}
