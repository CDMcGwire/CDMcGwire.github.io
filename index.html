  <h2><a href="projects_main.html">Projects</a></h2>
  <p>Worked on a few research projects in University. One in High Performance Computing, the other in Human Computer Interaction. Eventually I'll have non-gaming, personal projects to put on the page as well. Eventually.</p>

  <h2><a href="games_main.html">Games</a></h2>
  <p>Mostly prototypes to tryout different systems and tools at this point. I've got a puzzle-platformer type game from a University team project. Quite happy with that. I also have a small, but playable networked multiplayer game.</p>

  <h2><a href="nimbus_main.html">Nimbus</a></h2>
  <p>A custom Pen and Paper RPG ruleset that ended up being rather similar to the Fate RPG system from what I've read of it. It's lightweight system that uses narrative context to inform the game mechanics rather than stat lines.</p>
