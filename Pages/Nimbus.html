				<h2>What is this?</h2>
				<p>
					This is an experimental, pen-and-paper Roleplaying Game System.  It is designed to be lightweight and quick, requiring little setup allowing for sessions to start sooner and require less preparation time.

				<h2>State of Development</h2>
				<p>
					Currently, there are two versions of the system. The original (v1) behaves much more like a classic, fantasy, D&amp;D style game, but attempts to reduce many of the simulation and progression mechanics through a small amount of abstraction that relies on narrative hooks. v2, however, takes the concept further and removes stat lines entirely in favor for gameplay loop similar to the <a href="https://fate-srd.com/">Fate RPG system</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Generally, what I found with v1 is that it sat in a weird in-between, trying to revel in the familiar mechanics of a d20 system, but abandoning enough of them that the mechanics that remained felt hollow. Sessions were at their slowest when trying to follow the system, but were amazingly fun and memorable when we used the rules as a loose template where many of the mechanics went unused or forgotten.
				</p>
				<p>
					I decided to change the fundamental direction of the system after I designed a very quick, dirty RPG system using the Cards Against Humanity Illustrated pack. Originally, it was intended to be a silly joke for me and my friends but the joke game we played ended up being more intricate, fluid, and engrossing than any other RPG I had run or been part of.
				</p>
				<p>
					While many aspects could be responsible for this, such as the novel, political satire setting, a significant portion of it seems to be a result of allowing the players to play an active part in defining the world and rules, as opposed to relying on the DM to be provide all detail.
