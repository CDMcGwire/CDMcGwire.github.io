				<h2>What is this?</h2>
				<p>
					This is an experimental, pen-and-paper Roleplaying Game System.  It is designed to be lightweight and quick, requiring little fore-knowledge on the playerâ€™s part, allowing for sessions to start sooner and require less preparation time.

				<h2>State of Development</h2>
				<p>
					I am currently running sessions of the game with a limited group to test the initial usability of the game. Currently trying to hone in on what makes the game unique from other RPGs.
				</p>
				<h3>What's working?</h3>
				<p>So far, the magic system is working as intended, allowing significantly more flexibility than, say, D&D's system while maintaining comparble or even less complexity. But it needs stress testing.</p>
				<h3>What needs improvement?</h3>
				<p>Moment to moment gameplay still doesn't feel distinguished enough from similar systems.</p>
				<h3>What's coming next?</h3>
				<p>Tweaks to conventional combat system that will hopefully allow more creativity on the players' part, while giving the DM tools to quickly and systematically determine results. Also a more defined approach to using non-combat skills in game, will possibly take the form of a "Role" system.</p>
