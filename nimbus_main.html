        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Nimbus is a pen and paper roleplaying game, similar to classic games like Dungeons and Dragons. If you're here, I'm assuming you're already familiar with RPGs and are looking for an alternative to classic systems, like Dungeons and dragons.</p>
        <p>This system works in a fashion similar to the <a href="https://fate-srd.com/">FATE</a> system in that it attempts to remove hard coded stats. However, it tries to be more systematic, like a traditional game, reducing the reliance on a Game Master to progress the game along. It also attempts to be more approachable for those aren't used to improv style games.</p>

          <h3>Rolling</h3>
          <p>Roll 3d6 to determine success of an action:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1-3 = Blank</li>
            <li>4-5 = 1 Success</li>
            <li>6 = 2 Successes</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Picking a Setting</h2>
        <p>Nimbus is setting agnostic. The only limit is what the Game Master and players can imagine. You could have a historical adventure, playing through the events of some important moment in South African politics. Or, your could have your own version of Space Jam where the players have to face off against Michael Jordan and the Looney Toons.</p>
        <p>There's also nothing stopping the use of other game settings and scenarios. The only important part is picking something the GM and group find interesting.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Character Creation</h2>
        <p>Character creation, unlike traditional systems, is a group activity and just as much a part of 'playing' the game as the main loop. The required details of a character are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>Defining personality trait</li>
          <li>Defining personality flaw</li>
          <li>Driving goal</li>
          <li>Conflicting goal</li>
          <li>Defining Strength/Skill</li>
          <li>Defining Weakness/Shortcoming</li>
          <li>Signature Ability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a more detailed explanation and examples, refer to the character creation page.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Acting In-Game</h2>
        <p>Performing character actions is generally as simple as telling the Game Master what your character does. If the action is trivial, such as opening a window in an empty room, the GM will simply tell you what happens as a result.</p>
        <p>For non-trivial actions, like cooking dinner for the Queen of England or shooting a fly from 100 yards, the GM will consider the context of the task and your character's details and give you a difficulty for the task.</p>
        <p>There are six difficulties, each requiring a number of successes to complete:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy<br/> 1 success ~85% chance</li>
          <li>Medium<br/> 2 successes ~60% chance</li>
          <li>Hard<br/> 3 successes ~30% chance</li>
          <li>Very Hard<br/> 4 successes ~15% chance</li>
          <li>Rediculous<br/> 5 successes ~5% chance</li>
          <li>Impossible<br/> 6 successes ~0.5% chance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Success is determined by rolling three six-sided dice (3d6) where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1-3 = zero successes</li>
          <li>4-5 = one success</li>
          <li>6 = two successes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the core mechanic of the game and how most actions will be resolved.</p>

        <h3>Making a Case</h3>
        <p>The Game Master is always the final say when it comes to the game world, but it's not expected that they'll always have the best judgment and ultimately the goal is for everyone to enjoy the game.</p>
        <p>To that end, if a player thinks the difficulty their activity was assigned is inaccurate (say they were given a hard difficulty when their professional carnie tried to juggle knives) they are encouraged to make a short case to the GM why it should be reduced <em>before they roll</em>. It's also perfectly fine for other players to weigh in on the case and add support or counter-points.</p>
        <button class="button-context" value="gmn-makecase">GM Notes</button>
        <span class="content-anchor"><span class="sideview-text" id="gmn-makecase">
            <p>As the GM, you should try to resolve minor cases quickly opting to favor the health and fun of the game over precision and detail. Though that balance is, of course, subject to the group at hand.</p>
            <p>But, <em>do not shut down a group discussion.</em> If the party is having a fun time searching the internet or reasoning through the scenario to figure out how it should be ruled, then all the better. Let things go naturally.</p>
            <p>However, if things are dragging on and some players are noticeably unengaged, come to a conclusion and make it final.</p>
        </span></span>
        <p>If the GM likes your case, or can't think of a counter-point, the GM should lower the difficulty to something fitting the case.</p>
        <p><strong>The player cannot use new character information to form their case.</strong></p>
        <p>All cases must be built on events and character backgrounds that are already known to the group or at the very least the GM.</p>

        <h2>Experimental Rules</h2>
        <p>There are some optional mechanics players can use to add a little extra flavor to the game.</p>

        <h3>Player Archetypes</h3>
        <p>Players can opt to change up the way they roll by choosing an archetype. These change things like the number of dice and how they may roll them, but generally only have small effects on success rates. If a player wants to use one, they pick it at the beginning of the session and must keep it to the end.</p>
        <p>The current archetypes are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Planning ahead</strong><br/>
            Roll one dice before any action is decalared, and immediately after each action is finished, and store the result. The other two dice are then rolled when the you decide to make a rollable action.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Never Tell Me the Odds</strong><br/>
            You relinquish all your dice to the GM. You are never told the difficulty of the task, and the GM may elect to roll one extra dice and either add or subtract the value rolled.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Gambler's Spirit</strong><br/>
            Roll an extra twenty-sided die with all of your normal rolls. On a natural 20 you critically succeed any rollable task and on a 1 you critically fail, regardless of the 3d6 total. Criticals result in a monumental success or failure and the GM should invent a suitable effect and description for the event.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Buying Favors</strong><br/>
            You may ask the GM for a single extra dice on a roll in exchange for a favor. The GM may recall a favor on any of your <em>future</em> rolls to take away a dice of the GM's choice. You may have, at max, 3 favors owed, at which point you may no longer buy dice.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Butterfingered Savant</strong><br/>
            Roll a number of dice proportional to the difficulty of the task. You will use 2 dice for easy or medium tasks, 3 dice for hard or very hard, and 4 dice for ridiculous and impossible tasks.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Bucket Roller</strong><br/>
            Roll 12 dice instead of three, but only doubles count, and are only worth one.
          </li>
        </ul>
