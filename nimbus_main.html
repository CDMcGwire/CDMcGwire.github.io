        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Nimbus is a pen and paper roleplaying game, similar to classic games like Dungeons and Dragons. If you're here, I'm assuming you're already familiar with RPGs and are looking for an alternative to classic systems, like Dungeons and dragons.</p>
        <p>This system works in a fashion similar to the <a href="https://fate-srd.com/">FATE</a> system in that it attempts to remove hard coded stats. However, it tries to be more systematic, like a traditional game, reducing the reliance on a Game Master to progress the game along. It also attempts to be more approachable for those aren't used to improv style games.</p>

        <h2>Character Creation</h2>
        <p>Character creation, unlike traditional systems, is a group activity and just as much a part of 'playing' the game as the main loop. The required details of a character are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>Defining positive personality trait</li>
          <li>Defining negative personality trait</li>
          <li>Life goal</li>
          <li>Conflicting goal</li>
          <li>Defining Strength/Skill</li>
          <li>Defining Weakness/Shortcoming</li>
          <li>Signature Ability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Name</h3>
        <p>A good name is the difference between a neat story and a legend. It doesn't have to be incredibly creative, but aim to fit the theme. If the setting is Norse Mythology, 'Loki' would be appropriate, 'Destiny' would be out of place. Not different enough to contrast meaningfully, but too different to fit. Contrasting names work well if they contrast hard, such as a character named Bill in a ancient Chinese setting. Note that some settings are naturally more flexible than others.</p>
        <p>If you're hard pressed to come up with something, just use a tv character's name. Ever better, use one of the other player's names. That will really make things interesting.</p>

        <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
        <p>The next thing to determine is the character's defining personality traits. This is the 'How' of your character. The adjectives and adverbs. Your character must have one positive trait, something that people like the character and one negative, offputting trait that can make some situations difficult.</p>
        <h4>Example - Chumby the Half-Orc Enforcer</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Positive: </strong>Reliable and loyal companion</li>
          <li><strong>Negative: </strong>Always rough and intimidating</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>A character without goals provides no tension to the narrative. Sometimes that's fine in storytelling, but makes for less interesting games. Your character must have a driving goal and a conflicting goal. Driving goals should be simple and understandable, but take effort to achieve. Likewise, conflicting goals are best simple, but act as the bad habit or desire that hinder's the character as they attempt to achieve their main goal.</p>
        <h4>Example - Darren the Speechless Heister</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Driving Goal: </strong>Needs to steal and hold $1 Billion so he can fulfill a vow and speak again</li>
          <li><strong>Conflicting Goal: </strong>Wants to buy and drive expensive vehicles</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>Choosing strengths and weaknesses has the greatest effect the game mechanics, and is comparable to setting skills and attributes in a stat driven game. However, there are no numbers directly associated to, you simply state "my character is good at 'x' and bad at 'y' then the GM will make a given task easier for the character if it fits their skill set or harder if it plays into their weakness. The challenge is to pick your x's and y's in a way that isn't too general. As a rule of thumb, the more broad the skillset, the less it will effect individual tasks. If its a very narrow skillset, the more intense it should be.</p>
        <p>Ultimately it's up to the group to decide what sounds like a healthy skillset for a particular character, and the setting plays a large role in it too. If it's a specialized martial arts setting, more specific, subtle, combat related skills are likely more appropriate. Whereas a superhero setting would likely be better off with pretty extravagent skill sets.</p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strength: </strong>Good with knives - the character will usually succeed at tasks that require wielding a knife</li>
          <li><strong>Weakness: </strong>Bad with guns - the character will usually fail when attempting to fire, avoid, or maintain guns</li>
          <li><strong>Strength: </strong>Silver tongue - the character will usually succeed at tasks that require talking people into liking them or performing a task</li>
          <li><strong>Weakness: </strong>Clumsy - the character has a chance to fail at trivial, physical tasks where other characters may not even need to roll</li>
          <li><strong>Strength: </strong>Professional Artist - the character can reliably create good looking paintings, designs, or the like</li>
          <li><strong>Weakness: </strong>Bad at flirting - the character usually fails any attempt at romance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Signature Ability</h3>
        <p>This is where players can give their characters and ace in the sleeve. A signature ability is a very specific action the character can make that is guranteed to succeed if they are physically capable performing the action. </p>
        <h4>Example - </h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>: </strong></li>
          <li><strong>: </strong></li>
        </ul>
