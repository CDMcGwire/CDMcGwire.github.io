At the University of Washington Bothell campus, I participated in Undergraduate
Research to help develop class materials for a Graduate level High Performance
Computing (HPC) course.

<!--EndExcerpt-->

The research was led by Dr. Erika Parsons of the University of Washington.

## Goal

The purpose of the project was to establish a knowledge and technical base for
HPC study at the Bothell Campus. The course serves as an introductory lesson for
graduate students, with hopes of sparking further interest and development in
HPC.

The two main points of interest for the research were:

- Determing what expectations should be set when non-specific instructions are
  given to students.
- Further develop methods for introducing the knowledge of industry experts to
  students of vastly different mindsets.

## Role

Coming from no background in HPC, my role in the research was two-fold; learn as
much of the subject as I could to develop intoductory curriculum resources and
evaluate proposed lessons and resources from the perspective of a new student.

It was imperitive that I record my experiences when learning the material
myself, so that potential learning hurdles could be identified early on. To that
end I created a series of documents that walked through what I learned while
describing the sections in which difficulties were faced, what made it
difficult, and how I got through that hurdle.

## Results

Through my participation I gained a solid understanding of the core principles
of parallel computing and how to program for devices built to take advantage of
a high level of parallelization.

Technology-wise, I became familiar specifically with developing in an NVIDIA
CUDA environment on Linux for general purpose programming of Graphics Processing
Units. Many concepts used are, however, portable to other systems. Such as the
high level architecture of a GPU and the resource needs and limitations of that
style of programming.
