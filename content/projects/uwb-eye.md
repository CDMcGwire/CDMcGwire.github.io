My capstone project at the University of Washington Bothell. I had the
opportunity to work with the
[EYE Center (Educating Young Eyes)](http://educatingyoungeyes.org/index.php) on
research into novel computer use for diagnosing and treating near vision issues

The student research team was led by
[Bill Erdly of the University of Washington](https://www.uwb.edu/css/faculty/bios/werdly),
with assistance from
[Dr. Alan Pearson of Vision Clinics of Development and Learning](http://www.visioncdl.com/about_doctors.php).

## The EYE Center

The overarching purpose of the research was to determine what new roles
technology could play in helping diagnose and correct children's near vision
issues.

According to Dr. Pearson and many of his colleagues, untreated near vision
issues often have a massive negative effect on a child's ability to learn. This
is especially true if they are already dealing with learning disabilities like
Dyslexia.

Research at the time estimated that, out of one million students, 25% have
vision issues. The (at the time) standard distance and near acuity screening
given to those kids is able to detect myopia (nearsightedness) and amblyopia
(lazy eye). However, it is unable to detect the 130,000 who would have hyperopia
(farsightedness), 30,000 with strabismus (eye turn), or th 50,000 with
convergence insufficiency (inability to focus both eyes on the same point).

Clearly then, there was a gap in standard vision screening that needed to be
addressed. A gap that we suspected could be filled much more efficiently and
thoroughly with the assistance of digital technology.

## Role

My role in the project was as a Software Developer. By the time I joined, the
group already had several ideas for video games that they hoped students could
play both as part of the vision screening process and as a regular activity for
vision therapy. Some of the ideas already had rudimentary prototypes, however,
these prototypes needed a good deal more work to be usable for study.

In addition to refining the prototype games, I also assisted in the creation of
support tooling, such as a "library" application that would manage installed
trial applications and aid volunteers and patients in accessing them.

## Games for Research

One of the most prominent concerns with realizing the game prototypes into
usable tools was ensuring that the they could be rapidly tweaked and modified to
keep pace with the needs of the researchers that would be using them for study.

<!-- Up next: talking about the game I made. Getting pictures in. Commenting on
design decisions and lessons learned. Would be best to focus on the decisions I
made to make it expandable rather than trying to comment on how I think it
would do in the real world, since we never got that far. -->
