My capstone project at the University of Washington Bothell. I had the
opportunity to work with the EYE Center (Educating Young Eyes) on research into
novel computer use for diagnosing and treating near vision issues

The student research team was led by Bill Erdly of the University of Washington.

## Goal

Of particular interest, at the time of my involvement, was exploring how digital
games could be leveraged for near vision assessment, improvement, and
rehabilitation for children.

## Role

I served as a Software Engineer on the project and was responsible for turning
prototyped game concepts into functional builds. Due to the experimental nature
of the domain, emphasis was put into ensuring that the application was flexible
and ready for modification.

Occasionally I would also serve as a technical advisor to other members of the
team on general Android app development and frontend web technologies.
