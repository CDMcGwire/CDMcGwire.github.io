- Rust - Dabbling in with an interest in professional use

<!-- TODO: Put more emphasis on things I've built with the following technologies. -->

### Linux Based Systems

The primary _target_ platform of my professional development work. Aware of many
of its common concerns and very comfortable navigating and writing scripts for
its shell based Command Line Interfaces.

### Windows Based Systems

The platform I do most of my local testing, development, and day to day tasks
on. Not as familiar with some of the core SDK libraries as I would like to be.

### Apache Camel - Integration and Routing Framework

Leveraged Camel to implement message routing and transformation systems. Also
used the library to host REST APIs for internal support tooling. Familiar with
its core architecture and most of its common features.

### Angular - JavaScript Framework

Used in my professional work to build web based UIs for internal tooling.
Familiar with its core structure and concepts. Still learning its limits and
best practice.

### Vue - JavaScript Framework

Used in my personal web development projects. Learned in tandem with Angular to
get a better sense of the strengths and weaknesses of both and a better
understanding of modern web dev as a whole.

### Maven - JVM Based Build Tool

Setup many, many project build schemes using Maven. Mostly for Java based
projects, as was intended. Sometimes also for very much not Java based projects,
as was probably not intended, but was stable and reliable enough. ðŸ˜€

Experienced with integrating into other CI systems, like remote build servers,
unit test frameworks, and artifactories.

### Spring Framework - JVM Application Framework

Built and managed several production applications using Spring's dependency
injection, repository management, and web server features. Also toyed with its
more recent Reactive Web library to create responsive services.

### Unity 3D - Game Engine

Primary development tool for hobby projects. Very familiar with its .NET based
scripting API and through that the many concerns involved with developing
realtime, high performance applications. As well the benefits and tradeoffs of
the different methods of inter-system communication.
