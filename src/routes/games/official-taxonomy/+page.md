# The Completely Official Guide to Game Taxonomy

This is the definitive and comprehensive guide to classifying games by genre, the most sacred art. If you see any storefront sorting their games in a manner that conflicts with these definitions, that storefront should be shamed.

If your friends are calling something a puzzle game when it is merely a shooter with puzzle elements, you should shun them, but then offer this document as a path to mercy.

First, a definition of terms to keep us on the same page...

## Terminology

We'll keep these to terms that I either made up or are likely not well known. If something like "Player Character" is confusing to you, how did you get here?

- **Static Narrative** -- A pre-existing narrative explicitly included in the game by the developers and not discovered or created by the players.
  - It may include multiple scenarios that the player can shift between over the course of gameplay and may include multiple endings, but it must include at least one distinct "end."
  - The narrative does not have to use spoken or written language, but it must be clear to the player that the developer is telling a story. i.e. [Journey](https://www.igdb.com/games/journey) has a static narrative.
- **Dynamic Narrative** -- A narrative that was not defined explicitly by the developers and emerged as a consequence of the player's interaction or through community analysis of the game.
- **Exploits** -- Gameplay behaviour that is either explicitly stated as such by the devs, or generally agreed upon by the greater community to bypass the intended design of the game. (Not necessarily a negative thing)
- **Excessive Grinding** -- ~~Rubbing your~~ Replaying a section to get resources beyond the point needed to progress the game.

Now, to define the genres themselves. We will start with the most holy of them...

## Role-Playing Games

Alas, no genre better represents the utter depravity the gaming industry has fallen into. It is not in the mixing of genre elements by developers that the sin lies. Genre taxonomy afterall, serves the developer, not the other way around. However, it is the storefronts and the game databases that have comitted blasphemy.

Even Steam, the greatest of the platforms in terms of catalogue browsing technologies, still lets the MOBA "Smite" sit within the Top-Seller list of RPGs... ðŸ˜”

### Defining Traits

- Core game progression is tied to a **static narrative**.
- The player controls at least one named (or titled) character directly.
- The controlled characters' **intrinsic abilities** grow over the course of the game, but one character _cannot normally access all available abilities simultaneously_.
  - "Normal" meaning "without **exploits** or **excessive grinding**."

_"What about stats!?!"_ you might ask. In the progenitor Pen & Paper systems, numerical stats we're just a solution to "fill in the details" of the world simulation. All video games are built on that and simply choose how much of it to hide from the player. Therefore, it's not the stats that make the RPG but _how they change as the game progresses_.

### Subgenres

- **Action RPG** -- A game whose core progression systems classify it as an RPG but whose moment-to-moment gameplay classifies it as an Action Game.
  - Examples:<br/>[Diablo](https://www.igdb.com/games/diablo) -- Blizzard 1996<br/>[Mass Effect](https://www.igdb.com/games/mass-effect) -- BioWare (2007)
- **Computer RPG** -- A somewhat non-descriptive name, but works because of its legacy. RPGs that attempt to emulate the Pen & Paper RPG experience with as much detail as possible. May play in real-time, but will lack the 1:1 input control method needed to be an Action Game.
  - Examples:<br/>[Baldur's Gate](https://www.igdb.com/games/baldur-s-gate) -- BioWare (1998)<br/>[Disco Elysium](https://www.igdb.com/games/disco-elysium) -- ZA/UM (2019)
- **JRPG** -- An RPG made with core design elements popular among Japanese RPG developers. Typically thought of as "Anything that plays like Dragon Quest/Final Fantasy(pre XI)." However, more inclusively the defining traits are: systems that prefer abstraction and streamlining over simulation detail; a pre-defined player character; a linear central plot.
  - Examples:<br/>[Dragon Warrior (Quest)](https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-warrior) -- Chunsoft (1986)<br/>[Persona 5](https://www.igdb.com/games/persona-5) -- ATLUS (2016)
- **Western RPG** -- Like JRPG, really just a term to note it's made according to "Western" tastes: emphasis on simulation detail, player created characters, empahasis on player actions influencing the plot.
  - Examples:<br/>[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic](https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic) -- BioWare (2003)<br/>[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://www.igdb.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim) -- Bethesda Game Studios (2011)

## Action Games

(WIP)

### Subgenres

- **Brawler**
  - **Hack'n'Slash**
  - **Spectacle Fighter**
  - **Beat'em Up**
- **Platformer**
- **Action Sport** -- Skateboarding, wakeboarding, surfing, etc... Sports (real or fictional) where the goal is to perform a task with the highest degree of proficiency possible or with the greatest spectacle value.
  - Examples:<br/>[Tony Hawk Pro Skater](https://www.igdb.com/games/tony-hawk-s-pro-skater) -- Neversoft (1999)<br/>[Trials Evolution](https://www.igdb.com/games/trials-evolution) -- RedLynx (2012)
- **Vehicle** -- Games centered around the piloting of a vehicle.
  - **Arcade Racer** -- Games about racing vehicles with little regard to real-life physics.
    - Examples:<br/>[Super Mario Kart](https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-kart) -- Nintendo EAD (1992)<br/>[Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled](https://www.igdb.com/games/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled) -- Beenox (2019)
  - **Simulation Racer** -- Racing games that try to emulate real-life motorsport as accurately as possible. Typically feature copius car-porn but somehow bypass all censorship laws.
    - Examples:<br/>[Gran Turismo](https://www.igdb.com/games/gran-turismo) -- Polyphony Digital (1997)<br/>[Forza Motorsport 7](https://www.igdb.com/games/forza-motorsport-7) -- Turn 10 Studios (2017)
  - **Dogfighting** -- Games about flying vehicles shooting each other to bits.
    - Examples:<br/>[IL-2 Sturmovik](https://www.igdb.com/games/il-2-sturmovik) -- Maddox Games (2001)<br/>[Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown](https://www.igdb.com/games/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown) -- Project Aces (2019)
- **Shooter** -- Games where even pressing a button is often done with bullets.
  - **First Person Shooter** -- Shooters that are played from the controlled character's viewpoint.
    - Examples:<br/>[DOOM](https://www.igdb.com/games/doom) -- id Software (1993)<br/>[DOOM](https://www.igdb.com/games/doom--2) -- id Software (2016)
  - **Third Person Shooter** -- Shooters that are played with a perspective based just behind the controlled character... _You'd think this distinction wouldn't qualify a full subgenre, but when looking at things accurately is 90% of the game..._
    - Examples:<br/>[Max Payne](https://www.igdb.com/games/max-payne) -- Remedy Entertainment (2001)<br/>[Returnal](https://www.igdb.com/games/returnal) -- Housemarque (2021)
    - **Cover Shooter** -- A specific strain of TPS where combat revolves around gluing the character behind rocks before shooting. This branch is already starting to tie back into the parent genre as implicit cover systems gain popularity.
      - Examples:<br/>[Gears of War](https://www.igdb.com/games/gears-of-war) -- Epic Games (2006)<br/>[Uncharted 2](https://www.igdb.com/games/uncharted-2-among-thieves) -- Naughty Dog (2009)
  - **Top-Down Shooters** -- Shooters in which the camera perspective comes from above the controlled character.
    - Examples:<br/>[Asteroids](https://www.igdb.com/games/asteroids) -- Atari (1979)<br/>[Enter the Gungeon](https://www.igdb.com/games/enter-the-gungeon) -- Dodge Roll (2016)

## Fighting Games

_"Isn't this just an action game subgenre?"_ -- No.

Exhibit A: [Toribash](https://youtu.be/a0l9NVcPlDY?t=17)

Are you really going to try and say that's **_not_** a fighting game? That, ye seeker, is an honest-to-God, mano-a-mano, **turn-based fighting game**.

### Defining Traits

- A core gameloop centered entirely around beating one or more other human players in simulated combat.
  - As such, _one of a fighting game's core game modes must be competitive multiplayer_.
- Gameplay mechanics that are overwhelmingly based on player skill.
  - Randomized elements can exist but they must be de-emphasized, otherwise... it's a Party Game.

### Subgenres

- **Martial Arts Fighter** -- X number of dudes (gender neutral) walk into the ring and beat the crap out of each other with their martial art of choice until one side is left standing.
  - Examples:<br/>[Street Fighter II](https://www.igdb.com/games/street-fighter-ii) -- Capcom (1991)<br/>[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://www.igdb.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate) -- Sora (2018)
- **Competitive Shooter** -- _(Yeah... I said it)_ X number of dudes (gender neutral) walk into ~~the ring~~ _an arena_ and ~~beat~~ _shoot_ the crap out of each other with their ~~martial art of choice~~ _guns_ until one side is left standing... _or some arbitrary objective is completed_.
  - Examples:<br/>[Quake III Arena](https://www.igdb.com/games/quake-iii-arena) -- id Software (1999)<br/>[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege](https://www.igdb.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege) -- Ubisoft Montreal (2015)
- **Competitive Strategy Game** -- _(And I'm doubling down)_ X number of "military commanders" walk into ~~the ring an arena~~ contested land and ~~beat shoot~~ order their men (gender neutral) to beat the crap out of each other until one side is left standing... _or some arbitrary objective is completed_.
  - Examples:<br/>[Chess](https://www.chess.com/) -- Some Bloke (c. 15th Century AD)<br/>[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings](https://www.igdb.com/games/age-of-empires-ii-the-age-of-kings) -- Ensemble Studios (1999)
- **MOBA** -- Multiplayer Online Battle Arena... two teams of five walk onto the rift and...
  - Examples:<br/>[Defense of the Ancients](https://www.igdb.com/games/defense-of-the-ancients) -- Multiple Modders (2003)<br/>[League of Legends](https://www.igdb.com/games/league-of-legends) -- riTo Game (2009)

## Party Games

The Fighting Game's wacky uncle.

(WIP)

## Simulation Games

(WIP)

## Roguelikes

Why are these a major genre? Because what defines them is the core game loop itself. The moment-to-moment gameplay could be from any mix of other genres. As such, there really aren't Rougelike "subgenres." It's like the soup of gaming, to which "Rouge-lites" are the chowder.
