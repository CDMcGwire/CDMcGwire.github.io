For my capstone project at the University of Washington - Bothell campus, I had the opportunity to work with the EYE Center (Educating Young Eyes) on research into technology assisted functional vision development.

The student research team was led by Bill Erdly of the University of Washington.

## Goal
Of particular interest, at the time of my involvement, was exploring how digital games could be leveraged for near vision assessment, improvement, and rehabilitation for children.

## Role
I served as a Software Engineer on the project and was responsible for turning prototyped game concepts into functional builds. Due to the experimental nature of the domain, emphasis was put into ensuring that the application was flexible and ready for modification.

Occasionally I would also serve as a technical advisor to other members of the team on general Android app development and frontend web technologies.
