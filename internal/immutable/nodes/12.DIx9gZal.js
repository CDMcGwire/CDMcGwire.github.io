		“true” change. Until one night, under the shadows of that city’s shining towers, that “change”
		grasped John and the new era was ushered in by the clawed hands of a nightmare.</p> <p>When he comes to, he finds a golden mystery hidden in the wake of the horror. A mystery so

	who he belongs to. Of course, a bunch of dry philosophizing wouldn’t be much fun, so this city’s
