		oligarchy, but to people like John Nakae it was a chance to escape a life of stagnation and
		decay. For years, it was exactly that. Yet—for all their fervency—no one in the city could grasp
		‘true’ change.</p> <p>“Until one night, under the shadows of that city’s shining towers, that ‘change’ grasped John
		and the new era was ushered in by the clawed hands of a nightmare.</p> <p>“When he comes to, he finds a mystery in the wake of the horror so enticing he forgets the
		trauma of his near-death encounter, for in that mystery is the potential to finally reach that
		next step for the world… If only he can come to understand and control it before the light of
		his beloved city is snuffed out.”</p>`,b,d,R=`<em><strong>Metanoia</strong></em> is a paranormal sci-fi in a near-future setting that blurs the
	symbolic and the technical. It’s a very character driven tale about man’s pursuit of the new—of
	science and societal progress—and his duty to his past—to remember who he is, who came before, and
	who he belongs to. Of course, a bunch of dry philosophizing wouldn’t be much fun, so this city’s
	tale unfolds amidst high-stakes action… noir-inspired intrigue… a fair shake of romance…
