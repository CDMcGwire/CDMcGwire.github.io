				<h2>Attacking</h2>
				<p>Attacking consists of two rolls. The <strong>To-Hit</strong> roll and the <strong>Damage</strong> roll. The To Hit roll is done with a d20, while damage dice are determined by the weapon used.</p>
				<p>A To-Hit roll is made by selecting a target and, if in range, making a standard d20 roll (and apply any relevant modifiers) to see if you hit the target. Success is determined as usual, but the results have a set effect on the following damage roll.</p>
				
				<ul class="emphasized-list">
					<li>A result of 6 or lower fails - <strong>No damage</strong></li>
					<li>A result of 7-9 is partially successful - <strong>Half damage</strong></li>
					<li>A result of 10-16 is successful - <strong>Standard damage</strong></li>
					<li>A result of 17 or higher is very successful - <strong>Double damage</strong></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>If the attack lands, you may then deal damage to the target. Roll the set of dice indicated by your weapon, add in any modifiers you have accumulated, then modify the total as indicated by the level of success.</p>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Critical Rolls</summary>
					<p>Rolling a natural 20 on your To-Hit results in a full, double damage attack. No damage roll has to be made, simple add all of your modifiers to the highest possible roll you could make, then double. Even if the modified To-Hit total would be lower than 17, this attack will deal double, max damage.</p>
					<p>Rolling a natural 1, conversely, will result in a dramatic failure of an attack, even if your bonuses would bring you back up to a success. And, less the GM have mercy, will likely result in you hurting yourself.</p>
					<p>These are intended to represent the flukey situations that can occur in life. If success or failure were guranteed, you would not have to roll.</p>
				</details>

				<h2>Defense</h2>
				<p>To ward against attacks, there are two primary defenses: <strong>Armor</strong> and <strong>Agility</strong>. Both <strong>count as penalties to the attacker</strong>. Your Armor value is determined by what protective gear you are wearing, as well as any other passive protections whether natural or magical. Whereas your Agility is simply the attribute bonus.</p>
				<p>To calculate defense when attacked, add up your Armor, Agility, and any other situational modifers, then subtract the total from the attacker's roll.</p>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Bypassing Defense</summary>
					<p>There are several ways in which an attacker can reduce or negate a target's defense.</p>
					<h3>Negating Agility</h3>
					<p>If a target is flanked or their movement is impaired, they only receive half of their Agility defense. If they can't move, or are unaware of their assailent, their Agility is treated as -2. If the target's base Agility is lower than the calculated value, use the base Agility instead.</p>
					
					<h3>Piercing Armor</h3>
					<p>Some weapons and spells can damage a target through their armor, or slip past the armor entirely. Physical weapons may receive one of two tags:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Blow-Through:</strong> Halve the target's armor value</li>
						<li><strong>Piercing (#):</strong> Negate any armor lower than the given value</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Spells, on the other hand, are more varied and thus are specified in their own description.</p>
