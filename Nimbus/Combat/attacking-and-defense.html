				<h1>Attack and Defense</h1>
				<main>How to determine success in combat (or lack thereof)</main>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Attacking</h2>
				<p>Attacking consists of two rolls. The <strong>To-Hit</strong> roll and the <strong>Damage</strong> roll. The To Hit roll is done with a d20, while damage dice are determined by the weapon used.</p>
				<p>A To-Hit roll is made by selecting a target and, if in range, making a standard d20 roll (and apply any relevant modifiers) to see if you hit the target. Success is determined as usual, but the results have a set effect on the following damage roll.</p>
				
				<ul class="emphasized-list">
					<li>A result of 6 or lower - <strong>No damage</strong></li>
					<li>A result of 7-9 - <strong>Half damage</strong></li>
					<li>A result of 10-16 - <strong>Standard damage</strong></li>
					<li>A result of 17 - <strong>Double damage</strong></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>If the attack lands, you may then deal damage to the target. Roll the set of dice indicated by your weapon, add in any modifiers you have accumulated, then modify the total as indicated by the level of success.</p>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Critical Rolls</summary>
					<p>Rolling a natural 20 on your To-Hit results in a full, double damage attack. No damage roll has to be made, simple add all of your modifiers to the highest possible roll you could make, then double. Even if the modified To-Hit total would be lower than 17, this attack will deal double, max damage.</p>
					<p>Rolling a natural 1, conversely, will result in a dramatic failure of an attack, even if your bonuses would bring you back up to a success. And, less the GM have mercy, will likely result in you hurting yourself.</p>
					<p>These are intended to represent the flukey situations that can occur in life. If success or failure were guranteed, you would not have to roll.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Weapon Damage</summary>
					<p>Each weapon has a damage roll associated with. Most also have an associated attribute, which is then added directly into the roll total. Most melee weapons are based on strength, while a few are based on agility. Most ranged weapons to not have an attribute bonus, unless thrown.</p>
				</details>
				
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Defense</h2>
				<p>To ward against attacks, there are two primary defenses: <strong>Armor</strong> and <strong>Agility</strong>. Both <strong>count as penalties to the attacker</strong>. Your Armor value is determined by what protective gear you are wearing, as well as any other passive protections whether natural or magical. Whereas your Agility is simply the attribute bonus.</p>
				<p>To calculate defense when attacked, add up your Armor, Agility, and any other situational modifers, then subtract the total from the attacker's roll. As you might imagine, a negative defense total is a bonus to the attacker.</p>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Bypassing Defense</summary>
					<p>There are several ways in which an attacker can reduce or negate a target's defense.</p>
					<h3>Negating Agility</h3>
					<p>If a target is flanked or their movement is impaired, they only receive half of their Agility defense. If they can't move, or are unaware of their assailent, their Agility is treated as -2. If the target's base Agility is lower than the calculated value, use the base Agility instead.</p>
					
					<h3>Piercing Armor</h3>
					<p>Some weapons and spells can damage a target through their armor, or slip past the armor entirely. Physical weapons may receive one of two tags:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Blow-Through:</strong> Halve the target's armor value</li>
						<li><strong>Piercing (#):</strong> Negate any armor lower than the given value; If the target is completely unaware, ignore armor entirely</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Spells, on the other hand, are more varied and thus are specified in their own description.</p>
				</details>

				<h2>Health and Healing</h2>
				<p>As stated previously, hit-points represent your ability to stay in fighting shape, and do not directly translate to health.</p>
				<p>After combat, a character may take a short rest (15 minutes in game time) to restore half of the hit points they lost in the last fight. They can also opt for a longer rest, restoring 25% of max health per in-game hour.</p>

				<h2>Other Combat Rules</h2>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Attacks of Opportunity</summary>
					<p>Certain actions, such as attempting to cast a spell or sprinting, illicit a free attack from opponents that are in range with a melee weapon. This attack is made as normal, is optional, and only one such attack may be made per combat round.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Casting Spells</summary>
					<p>The exact mechanism by which spells are cast is determined by the school it belongs to. As such, each school provides a different play experience. Wizards and Sorcerers are nuanced and generally love this nuance. Details will be explained on the School's page.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Grappling</summary>
					<p>To attempt to grab an opponent, a character must make a To-Hit roll as usual, however, the target’s armor score is ignored unless stated otherwise by the armor type. No immediate damage is dealt against the target. A choking attack can be made on subsequent turns to deal <strong>d4+Brawn</strong> non-lethal damage.</p>
					<p>To break free, the victim must make an opposed roll with either Brawn or Agility against their opponent’s Brawn. This an opposed role, where attribute bonuses apply as normal, but success is determined purely by who rolls higher. Ties go to the victim of the grapple. One break attempt may be made on each of the victim’s proceeding turns, until they pass out or escape.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Non-Lethal Weapons</summary>
					<p>Some weapons blow through armor or can slip past it entirely. When hit by a weapon with Blow-through, a character is considered as having half their total armor bonus. A weapon with Piercing does not consider the targets armor when determining whether it deals half, full, or double damage. But still uses it to determine hit or miss.</p>
					<p>For instance, if a target has an armor value or 2 and the attacker has no hit bonus, the attacker would need to roll a natural dice total 13 or higher to hit the opponent, but would deal double damage at a roll of 18 as normal instead of 20. Bonus from speed or magic is unaffected, so a defense of 2 from speed will require the attacker to roll a dice total of 20.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary name="splash-damage">Splash Damage</summary>
					<p>Attacks desginated as splash damage do not need to make a to-hit roll to damage anything within range (though some may require a roll to ensure they hit the intended area).</p>
					<p>Instead, these attacks require their targets to pass Agility rolls to avoid the damage. Here, a critical success grants a free move action.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Unarmed Combat</summary>
					<p>Damage for an unarmed attack is a d4+Brawn</p>
					<p>If both the attacker and defender have no weapon, rolls play out as normal. If the attacker has a weapon but the opponent does not, the attacker gets a +2 bonus to hit.</p>
