					<summary>The Basic Process</summary>
					<p>At certain points during an adventure your party will find themselve in an all out brawl of some sort. Combat is handled in a turn based fashion, where each involved character rolls initiative to determine order, then they precede to take actions one at a time. A full set of turns is a <strong>Round</strong> and it represents around 5 to 6 seconds.</p>
					<p>The process is thus:</p>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<li>Combat encounter is formally announced by the GM.</li>
						<li>Initiative is rolled.</li>
						<li>All participants take turns making an action and/or move.</li>
						<li>When the round is over, reroll initiative.</li>
						<li>Repeat last two steps until the GM deems the encounter "over"</li>
					</ul>
				</details>
			
				<details>
					<summary>The Encounter</summary>
					<p>An encounter starts when a player character is involved combat, whether they start it or they get dragged into it. An encounter also starts when the GM says it does. Simple as that.</p>
					<p>The encounter ends when all hostility ends, or the GM says it ends. An encounter consists as a series of rounds in which each involved character take turns to perform actions in an attempt to resolve hostilities.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Initiative</summary>
					<p>Initiative is based off the rolling character or NPC’s Speed attribute.</p>
					<p><strong>The Roll:</strong> d20 + (2 x Agility)</p>
					<p>The highest roller goes first. Ties go to the one with a higher base Agility, then to who has a higher base Perception, then a roll-off if it keeps going.</p>
				</details>

				<h2>Your Turn</h2>
				<p>On your turn, you may move and take an action, possibly multiple small action if your GM allows. A turn represents approximately 5 seconds of real world time.</p>
					
				<details>
					<summary>Movement</summary>
					<p>Base Movement Speed = 30 (in game) feet per turn + 5 feet for every 2 points of Agility above 0. On a square grid, 5’ equals one square. On a hex grid, it is equal to one hex. If no grid is used, 5’ in game is one real-life inch.</p>
					<p>During your turn, you may forgo an action to sprint, thus doubling your movement that turn. Ranged attacks suffer a -2 to hit a sprinting target. However, sprinting allows characters in melee range to take an Attack of Opportunity as described later.</p>
					
					<h3>Impaired Movement</h3>
					<p>If the GM declares your movement impaired, your move speed is halved. If the GM declares you heavily impaired, you can move no more than 5 feet per turn.</p>
					<p>Common causes of impairment are: Climbing, walking on uneven surfaces, injured legs, and the like.</p>
					
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>An "Action"</summary>
					<p>Things that are hard ruled as taking an action:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Making a single attack</li>
						<li>Grabbing an item (or person)</li>
						<li>Opening a door/window</li>
						<li>Throwing an item (or person)</li>
						<li>Casting a spell</li>
						<li>Smashing or lifting objects</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Spell casting can vary in how long it takes for the spell to finish. This will be stated in the spell’s description. If unstated, it’s a single turn.</p>
					<p><em>An unwritten action is up to the GM’s discretion.</em></p>
					<p>Some actions don’t require much time and can be slipped into a standard round of action. Such as saying, “I look at the window.” Looking is an action, but a single glance takes next to no time. If you say examine the window, that’s a full action as you are closely studying the window and taking time to note the details.</p>
					<p>Generally, a player may do 1 or 2 quick actions in their turn, depending on the action taken (once again, up to the GM’s discretion). Any more than that, and it takes a full action.</p>
