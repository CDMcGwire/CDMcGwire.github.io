				<details>
					<summary class="inner-summary">On Fire</summary>
					<p>To reiterate from the Fire and Explosions section, a creature on fire will take 1d4 fire damage at the end of their turn until they die or the flame is put out. The creature may put it out themself by passing an Agility roll. They may attempt one roll per turn. Some other creature may attempt to put it out for them by passing an Agility roll.</p>
					<p>Some special types of fire will modify this status effect. Those rules override this one.</p>
				</details>
				
				<a href="#stun"></a>
				<details>
					<summary class="inner-summary">Stun</summary>
					<p>A stunned creature, through whatever means stunned it, is unable to operate clearly physically or mentally for the period of the stun. They are not considered unconscious and are somewhat aware of their surroundings, but they are unable to act and lose their Agility defense.</p>
				</details>
				
				<a href="slow"></a>
				<details>
					<summary class="inner-summary">Slow</summary>
					<p>A slowed creature cannot move and attack in the same turn, suffers a -1 to hit, and can only move at half speed. Cancels out the <strong>Haste</strong> status.</p>
