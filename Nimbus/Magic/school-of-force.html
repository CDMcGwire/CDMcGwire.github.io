				<p>The School of Force focuses on telekinetics. The art of moving objects remotely. It is considered by many magicians to be one of the simplest schools in concept, but takes every bit as much discipline to execute.</p>
				
				<h2>Casting Cost</h2>
				<p>Spells in this school require an Intellect roll to cast. Any extra penalties or bonuses to the roll will be specified by the spell being cast. Failing the rolls can result in various effects, from simply nothing happening to passing out from exhaustion (in the case of the very high level spells).</p>

					<summary>1<sup>st</sup> Rank</summary>
					<p>First rank force mages may make a cast roll to manipulate objects lighter than (10 x Intellect) pounds and within 20 + (10 x Intellect) feet. A manipulated object may be moved to another location within casting range. Or it may be <a href="../Combat/attacking-and-defense.html#throwing">thrown</a> using the caster's Intellect for "to-hit" and damage.</p>
					<p><strong>If the spell fails, nothings happens.</strong></p>
