				<p>The School of Force focuses on telekinetics. The art of moving objects remotely. It is considered by many magicians to be one of the simplest schools in concept, but takes every bit as much discipline to execute.</p>
				
				<h2>Casting Cost</h2>
				<p>Spells in this school require an Intellect roll to cast. Any extra penalties or bonuses to the roll will be specified by the spell being cast. Failing the rolls can result in various effects, from simply nothing happening to passing out from exhaustion (in the case of the very high level spells).</p>

					<summary>1<sup>st</sup> Rank</summary>
					<p>First rank force mages may make an Intellect roll (with a +2) to manipulate objects lighter than (10 x Intellect) pounds and within 20 + (10 x Intellect) feet. A manipulated object may be moved to another location within casting range. Or it may be <a href="../Combat/attacking-and-defense.html#throwing">thrown</a> using the caster's Intellect for "to-hit" and damage.</p>
					<p>This can also be used to activate devices, pull levers, and other similar actions.</p>
					<p><strong>If the spell fails, nothings happens.</strong></p>

					<summary>2<sup>nd</sup> Rank</summary>
					<!-- At rank 2, force mages gain the ability to apply a directional force to a creature of man size -->
					<p>At second rank, a force mage can apply a directional force to objects the size of an average human. If the caster passes an Intellect roll, they can push a target 5 feet for every 2 points of Intellect in a direction of their choice, if they are within 60 feet. If the target is pushed into a hazard (such as spikes, lava, cliffs, etc.) the target may make an Agility roll to stop short of being pushed into the hazard. Pushing a target skyward halves the distance of the push.</p>
					<p>If the caster's Agility is at least +2, this spell may be cast as an <a href="../Combat/attacking-and-defense.html#immediate-reactions">immediate reaction</a> to a moving object within range. Such as a throwing weapon or a charging creature. A successful cast halts or slows the target if pushed in the opposite direction. If the target is pushed to the side, it will continue in the same direction, but offset to the side by the standard push distance. If the target was falling, it slows them down to enough to stop fall damage... as long as they land within a round.</p>
					<p><strong>Failing this roll will disable casting for 1 turn.</strong></p>
