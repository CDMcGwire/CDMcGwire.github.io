				<h1>School of Nature</h1>
				<main>Art of the Elven</main>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<p>The School of Nature is the human name given to a type of magic created by the Elves. Spells in this school are centered around influencing the growth of living things. As such, practicioners of this school are often effective medics and doctors, accelerating the natural healing process and slowing harmful growths and diseases.</p>
				<p>Non-elven practicioners are often called druids.</p>
				
				<h2>Casting Cost</h2>
				<p>Most spells of this school do not require an explicit cost. However, they do require a great deal of focus on the part of the caster. More often than not, they are also slower to cast than many other spells of equal rank.</p>
				
				<details>
					<summary class="inner-summary">Losing Concentration</summary>
					<p>Most Nature spells require channelling to sustain an effect. A druid may move or perform simple actions while maintaining focus. This focus can be broken by several means.</p>
					<ul>
						<strong>The following events disrupt channeling for one turn:</strong>
						<li>Taking damage</li>
						<li>Attempting to cross uneven terrain</li>
						<li>Being moved forcibly</li>
						<li>Making an acrobatic movement</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Incapacitating effects, like stuns, cancel all spells until the effect ends.</strong></p>
				</details>
				
				<h2>Biomes</h2>
				<p>Nature, is of course, not constrained to one type of growth. As the surrounding environment changes, so to will a Nature mage's spells adapt.</p>

					</ul>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>2<sup>nd</sup> Rank</summary>
					<p>At second rank, a Nature mage begins their forray into calling forth plant life to assist them.</p>
					
					<h3>Plant Trap</h3>
					<p>A nature mage may use an action to grow a special plant within 10 feet. This will disrupt channeling. Plants are destroyed automatically when attacked by an enemy, but will otherwise stay indefinitely. The types of plants that may be summoned are the following:</p>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<li><strong>Heel Nibbler:</strong> A small, venus fly-trap like plant that bites at the heels of an enemy in the same square dealing d4 damage and disrupting a move action.</li>
						<li><strong>Poison Bloom:</strong> A brightly colored, and puffy looking plant that shoots poison mist at the first enemy to pass by. The target must pass a <strong>Brawn roll</strong> or suffer a -3 To-Hit for the remainder of combat (does not stack). The plant withers away after activating.</li>
						<li><strong>Seed Shooter:</strong> A slender plant with a bulbous pod at it's head that shoots acid covered seeds at targets. If an opponent starts it's turn or moves within 20 feet, it is shot at immediately for <strong>d2 damage</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Old Growth</h3>
					<p>The nature mage may use an action to fill dead wood with life in order to sprout a new feature from it. Target materials include, but are not limited to, objects like furniture, weapon hits, arrow shafts, and the like. Some special growths include:</p>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<li><strong>Thorns:</strong> Applies a stacking 1 point of <a class="in-line-link" href="../Adventuring Aid/generic-objects.html#sizes">bleeding damage</a> when touched carelessly</li>
						<li><strong>Moss:</strong> Makes the surface slippery. A weapon coated in moss would have a -4 To-Hit penalty and the holder would have to pass an Agility roll to hold on after swinging.</li>
					</ul>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>3<sup>rd</sup> Rank</summary>
					<p>At third rank, the nature mage's attunement with the land becomes strong enough to shape it to their will for some time.</p>
					<h3>Refuge of the Land</h3>
					<p>By channeling intensely for 1 round, the Nature mage may shape the terrain around them. This comes in a the form of placing a new natural feature onto the surrounding area. Features may be placed with 45 feet of the channeler and include:</p>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<li><strong>Wall of Shrubbery:</strong> A dense patch of plant growth up to 15 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 8 feet high.</li>
						<li><strong>Tree:</strong> A small tree up to a foot in diameter, and 30 feet tall. Branches expand naturally as befits the species of tree.</li>
						<li><strong>Tall Grass:</strong> A patch of grass, up to 20 feet in diameter can be grown to waist-height.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Channeling for this spell interupts any other actions and no other actions may be taken on that turn.</p>
