			<section>
				<p>The School of Nature is the human name given to a type of magic created by the Elves. Spells in this school are centered around influencing the growth of living things. As such, practicioners of this school are often effective medics and doctors, accelerating the natural healing process and slowing harmful growths and diseases.</p>
				<p>Non-elven practicioners are often called druids.</p>
				
				<h2>Casting Cost</h2>
				<p>Most spells of this school do not require an explicit cost. However, they do require a great deal of focus on the part of the caster. More often than not, they are also slower to cast than many other spells of equal rank.</p>
				
				<details>
					<summary class="inner-summary">Losing Concentration</summary>
					<p>Most Nature spells require channelling to sustain an effect. A druid may move or perform simple actions while maintaining focus. This focus can be broken by several means.</p>
					<ul>
						<strong>The following events disrupt channeling for one turn:</strong>
						<li>Taking damage</li>
						<li>Attempting to cross uneven terrain</li>
						<li>Being moved forcibly</li>
						<li>Making an acrobatic movement</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Incapacitating effects, like stuns, cancel all spells until the effect ends.</strong></p>
