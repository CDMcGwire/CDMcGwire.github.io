				<h1>Justicars</h1>
				<main>Bastions of Law and Order</main>

			<section>
				<p>A Justicar is a zealous spell caster that draws their power from the pursuit of Justice. Their spells draw power from the law of the land they stand in. Only a proven criminal has a reason to fear their power. However, it is not unheard of for vigilantes of incredible conviction to define their own code of morality.</p>
				
				<h2>Casting Cost</h2>
				<p>In order to cast a spell, a Justicar must see proof of a crime. Either witnessing it themself, or by discovering solid evidence. The severity of the crime comitted determines the strength of the spell.</p>
				<p>Justicars must maintain a consistant code of honor (meaning players need to write down and show the GM). If the target broke a law that conflicts with the Justicar's code, the spell will falter and fail.</p>
				
				<h3>Champion | Vigilante</h3>
				<p>Justicars players submit themselves to a morality score of sorts. As an adventure progresses, the GM may decide an action of yours is fitting of either a <strong>Champion</strong> or <strong>Vigilante</strong>. Here a Champion means someone who does things by the books. Champion actions are those that follow the order of law as best as possible. Vigilantes, on the other hand, see themselves as the hand of Justice, ignoring the intermediary steps to punish a criminal.</p>
				<p>Your character's leaning is determined by your GM, based on your recent actions. Your current standing effects your spells in various ways. Champions are generally more reliable, but slower. Whereas Vigilantes are fast, but unstable.</p>

					<h3>Divine Arrest</h3>
					<p>At first level, the Justicar may apprehend a criminal with mystical bindings. The strength of the effect is determined by the severity of the crime.</p>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<li>A minor crime is met with a 1 turn hand binding, giving a negative -5 to any action requiring hands.</li>
						<li>A moderate crime shackles the feet as well, disallowing a move action.</li>
						<li>A severe crime further illicits a silence and complete inability to perform a task with their arms.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p><strong>Champions</strong> casting Divine Arrest have the effect last 1 round longer.</p>
					<p><strong>Vigilantes</strong> may cast Divine Arrest as an immediate interrupt.</p>
