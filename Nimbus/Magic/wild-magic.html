				<h1>Wild Magic</h1>
				<main>A very special trait</main>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>How it Works</h2>
				<p>If you have the Wild Magic trait, you will <strong>roll an extra d20 whevenever you cast a spell or whenever any sort of magic first effects you</strong>. If a natural 20 is rolled, you will determine what kind of effect occurs using the following table.</p>
				<p>The Wild Magic trait exists to give players the option to introduce a touch of chaos into the game. There is a 5% chance (a natural 20 on a d20 roll), that any magic effecting or cast from a player will result in some random effect. This section explains the effect generation process.</p>
				<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This page will refer to the entity a magic effect originates from as the 'source.' The 'target' is who or whatever the spell effects. If the table says the 'Spell' is effected, than it replaces the entirety of the triggering spell. 'Effect' refers to a change in the end result, but not necessarily the means of delivery.</em></p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Determining Base Effect</h2>
				<p>To determine what effect occurs, roll <em>another</em> d20 then match the number to this table:</p>
				<ul class="wordy-list">
					<li><strong>1:</strong> The effect dies out completely; If it was from an enchanted item, the item loses its enchantment.</li>
					<li><strong>2-5:</strong> The effect explodes <em>centered on the source!</em> Roll on the Explosion table below.</li>
					<li><strong>6:</strong> The effect results in some catastrophic event for the party. Roll the Doom table!</li>
					<li><strong>7:</strong> Any rolls associated with the effect are criticals. Flip a coin to determine if it's a Critical Success or Failure.</li>
					<li><strong>8-10:</strong> The effect explodes <em>centered on the target!</em> Roll on the Explosion table.</li>
					<li><strong>11:</strong> The effect happens at 1/100th speed. Power stays the same, It's just... slow.</li>
					<li><strong>12:</strong> Something is summoned... Roll on the Summoning Table.</li>
					<li><strong>13:</strong> The effect is inverted! The source becomes the target. If the source was an enchanted object, roll on the Feedback table.</li>
					<li><strong>14:</strong> Every living thing within 60 feet of the effect's target must make an Intellect roll with a -2 penalty, or it is sent into a state of primal fear. The affected being may make the same roll once per turn to end the effect.</li>
					<li><strong>15:</strong> Something weird happens... Roll the Weird table.</li>
					<li><strong>16-18:</strong> The effect becomes some other effect. Roll the Random Effect table.</li>
					<li><strong>19:</strong> Every living creature within 60 feet of the effect's target has a sudden bout of clumsiness. Any held items are dropped, and all affected must make an Agility roll with a -2 penalty, or they will fall to the ground.</li>
					<li><strong>20:</strong> The effect results in something greatly beneficial to the party! Roll the Deus Ex Machina table.</li>
				</ul>
