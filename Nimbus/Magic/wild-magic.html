				<h1>Wild Magic</h1>
				<main>A very special trait</main>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>How it Works</h2>
				<p>If you have the Wild Magic trait, you will <strong>roll an extra d20 whevenever you cast a spell or whenever any sort of magic first effects you</strong>. If a natural 20 is rolled, you will determine what kind of effect occurs using the following table.</p>
				<p>The Wild Magic trait exists to give players the option to introduce a touch of chaos into the game. There is a 5% chance (a natural 20 on a d20 roll), that any magic effecting or cast from a player will result in some random effect. This section explains the effect generation process.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Determining Base Effect</h2>
				<p>To determine what effect occurs, roll <em>another</em> d20 then match the number to this table:</p>
				<ul class="wordy-list">
					<li><strong>1:</strong> The effect dies out completely; If it was from an enchanted item, the item loses its enchantment.</li>
					<li><strong>2-5:</strong> The effect explodes <em>centered on the source!</em> Roll on the Explosion table below.</li>
					<li><strong>6:</strong> The effect results in some catastrophic event for the party. Roll the Doom table!</li>
					<li><strong>7:</strong> Any rolls associated with the effect are criticals. Flip a coin to determine if it's a Critical Success or Failure.</li>
					<li><strong>8-10:</strong> The effect explodes <em>centered on the target!</em> Roll on the Explosion table.</li>
					<li><strong>11:</strong> The effect happens at 1/100th speed. Power stays the same, It's just... slow.</li>
					<li><strong>12:</strong> Something is summoned... Roll on the Summoning Table.</li>
					<li><strong>13:</strong> The effect is inverted! The source becomes the target. If the source was an enchanted object, roll on the Feedback table.</li>
					<li><strong>14:</strong> Every living thing within 60 feet of the effect's target must make an Intellect roll with a -2 penalty, or it is sent into a state of primal fear. The affected being may make the same roll once per turn to end the effect.</li>
					<li><strong>15:</strong> Something weird happens... Roll the Weird table.</li>
					<li><strong>16-18:</strong> The effect becomes some other effect. Roll the Random Effect table.</li>
					<li><strong>19:</strong> Every living creature within 60 feet of the effect's target has a sudden bout of clumsiness. Any held items are dropped, and all affected must make an Agility roll with a -2 penalty, or they will fall to the ground.</li>
					<li><strong>20:</strong> The effect results in something greatly beneficial to the party! Roll the Deus Ex Machina table.</li>
				</ul>
