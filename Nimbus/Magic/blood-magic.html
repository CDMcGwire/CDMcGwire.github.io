				<h1>Blood Magic</h1>
				<main>Dark arts for dominating living beings</main>

			<section>
				<p>Blood Mages tap directly into the life force of creatures to cast spells that influence or control the minds of others. Theirs is a life of sacrifice for power. A give and take of the soul.</p>
				
				<h2>Casting Cost</h2>
				<p>Spells by practitioners of Blood Magic are powered by sacrifice. The level of sacrifice required is specified by the spell entry.</p>

					<summary>1<sup>st</sup> Rank</summary>
					<p>First rank spells require an ounce of blood to cast. The number of active effects the caster may have active at one time is equal to their Intellect bonus.</p>
					<h3>Cloud Mind</h3>
					<p>A Blood Mage may use their sacrifice to cloud a creature's mind. The targeted creature must pass an Intellect roll, subtracting the caster's Intellect Bonus, otherwise they are left in a state of suggestion. While in this state, the caster may issue a command which the target will then attempt to perform. If the creature was not in combat or a hostile state, the effect lasts until the task is finished or 5 minutes pass. If in combat, the time limit is 2 rounds.</p>
					<p>Issuing an extreme command (such as killing an ally, themself, or doing something against their morals) grants the target another Intellect roll to resist the command, minus the caster's Charisma bonus. If they pass that roll, they do not follow through with the command but remain in a daze for the half the normal effect length.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>2<sup>nd</sup> Rank</summary>
					<p>Second rank spells requires at least a full wine glass or chalice worth of blood.</p>
					
					<h3>Steal Essence</h3>
					<p>The caster channels the sacrifice into temporary hit-points for the caster or some target within 15 feet. The amount of hit-points is equal to 1d4 + Intellect. These hit points do not heal the target, and wear off at the end of a combat encounter or 5 minutes if cast outside of combat.</p>
					
					<h3>Blood Rage</h3>
					<p>The caster channels the sacrifice to send a creature into a primal, bloodlust rage. The target must pass an Intellect roll minus the Caster's Intellect bonus, or they are compelled to attack the most injured creature (based on percentage of total health) in their line-of-sight or within their ability to smell. The attack is made with whatever weapon they had in hand when the effect triggers. Any attack made during the effect is resolved as normal, but with a -2 to-hit and +2 damage.</p>
					<p>The effect lasts for 3 rounds of combat. If the target is not in combat initially, or there are no injured creatures in sight, they will simply attack the nearest creature.</p>
