			</section>
			
			<section>
				<p>The School of Conduction studies the use of magic for the purpose of moving energy in various forms. For early practitioners, this manifests as the ability to ignite, freeze, or electrify targets. Masters of the art can create explosions from everyday objects and can form localized storms.</p>
				
				<h2>Casting Cost</h2>
				<p>Conduction spells require drawing thermal energy from one target in order to concentrate it onto another target. This comes in the form of charges. Each rank of spells come with abilities that generate charges and ones that expend charges.</p>
				<p>At most, your character may hold up to <strong>(3 x Intellect Bonus) charges</strong>. No more <em>generating</em> spells may be cast once you hit the cap, and if you cast a generating spell that would overfill your charge pool, those extra points are lost.</p>

It can not, however, bring an object's temperature below the freezing point of water. Affects a volume of material up to the average volume of a human.</p>
