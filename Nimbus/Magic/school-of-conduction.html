				<h1>School of Conduction</h1>
				<main>Manipulating energy to freeze or burn</main>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<p>The School of Conduction studies the use of magic for the purpose of moving energy in various forms. For early practitioners, this manifests as the ability to ignite, freeze, or electrify targets. Masters of the art can create explosions from everyday objects and can form localized storms.</p>
				<p>Practioners in the school are often referred to as Conductors.</p>
				
				<h2>Casting Cost</h2>
				<p>Conduction spells require drawing thermal energy from one target in order to concentrate it onto another target. This comes in the form of charges. Each rank of spells come with abilities that generate charges and ones that expend charges.</p>
				<p>At most, your character may hold up to <strong>(3 x Intellect Bonus) charges</strong>. No more <em>generating</em> spells may be cast once you hit the cap, and if you cast a generating spell that would overfill your charge pool, those extra points are lost.</p>

				<details>
					<summary>1<sup>st</sup> Rank</summary>
					<p>A dabbler in the School of Conduction can transfer a mild amount of energy through direct contact. Either chilling a target to draw energy or expending energy by heating or electrically charging.</p>
					<p><strong>Targeting hostile creatures:</strong> If a 1<sup>st</sup> rank spell targets an enemy directly, the caster must make a to-hit roll adding in their Unarmed proficiency bonus (or penalty if untrained).</p>
					
					<h3>Chill</h3>
					<p>By grabbing an object you may draw the thermal energy from it granting 1 charge. Another charge can not be taken from the object until the effect wears off or is cancelled out, nor can frozen objects be targeted.</p> 
					<p><strong>When used on an inanimate object</strong> you can bring it from room temperature to just above the freezing point of water or from heated to room temperature. It can not, however, bring an object's temperature below the freezing point of water. Affects a volume of material up to the average volume of a human.</p>
					<p><strong>When used on a creature</strong> you <a href="../Adventuring Aid/status-effects.html#slow">slow</a> their movement for two turns. If they are on fire, it puts out the flame and does not slow.</p>
					<p><strong>When used on a weapon</strong> the next attack made with that weapon will cause a one turn <a href="../Adventuring Aid/status-effects.html#slow">slow</a>.</p>
					
					<h3>Heat</h3>
					<p>By spending 1 charge, you may heat an object you can touch. Unlike Chill, Heat may be recast on a target before the effect wears off to increase the effect up to a limit.</p>
					<p><strong>When used on an inanimate object</strong> a volume of material up to the volume of the average human may be heated to the ignition point of wood and other flammable materials. Small objects, like arrows or a cup of water, take only 1 cast to ignite/boil. Medium objects, like chairs and puddles, take 2 casts. Large objects, like doors, take 3 casts.</p>
					<p><strong>When used on a creature</strong> you deal 1d6 damage per cast to the creature as its insides begin to boil. If successfully used three rounds in a row, man-sized or smaller creatures are killed outright.</p>
					<p><strong>When used on a weapon</strong> the next attack with that weapon gains <a href="../Combat/attacking-and-defense.html">Piercing(2)</a>. Arrows and other flammable projectiles can be set aflame in an <a href="../Adventuring Aid/fire-and-explosions.html">attempt to ignite</a> the target.</p>
					
					<h3>Shock</h3>
					<p>By spending 1 charge, you can shock or ionically charge a touched object.</p>
					<p><strong>When used on an inanimate object</strong> if the object can hold an electrical charge (usually metals), it is electrically charged. If a creature touches the object, it is <a href="../Adventuring Aid/status-effects.html#stun">stunned</a> for 1 round. Non-conductive materials, like wood, are simply burned slightly.</p>
					<p><strong>When used on a creature</strong> the creature is <a href="../Adventuring Aid/status-effects.html#stun">stunned</a> for one round, if they are roughly human size or smaller. Larger creatures are merely interrupted briefly.</p>
					<p><strong>When used on a weapon</strong> the next attack made with that weapon <a href="../Adventuring Aid/status-effects.html#stun">stuns</a> the target.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>2<sup>nd</sup> Rank</summary>
					<p>At second rank, a Conductor is able to cast their spells at a range of:
					<br/><strong>15 + (10 x Intellect) + (5 x Perception) feet</strong></p>
					<p>The cost of burn and shock goes up to 2 charges, while a ranged Chill still only generates 1 charge. A ranged cast that directly targets a hostile creature must pass a Perception roll against the enemies Agility defense, or it misses entirely. Armor does not affect this roll.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>3<sup>rd</sup> Rank</summary>
					<p>At third rank, a Conductor becomes capable of tranferring larger amounts of energy at one time and creating more extreme changes in energy. This effects the Chill, Heat, and Spark in the following ways:</p>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<li><strong>Chill</strong> can now, optionally, effect everything in a 10 foot radius from the target point. Doing so generates 1 charge for every living creature or heat source in the area, otherwise it generates nothing. As before, chilled targets do not generate charges.</li>
						<li><strong>Heat</strong> can now, optionally, expend 3 charges to be cast as a 10 foot radius burst of fire. Creatures caught in the burst must pass an Agility roll or they are <a href="../Adventuring Aid/status-effects.html#fire" class="in-line-link">set on fire</a>. Flammable objects caught in the burst are also set on fire.</li>
						<li><strong>Shock</strong> can now, optionally, expend 2 charges to effect a second creature within 15 feet of the original target.</li>
					</ul>
