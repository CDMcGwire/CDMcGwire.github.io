  		<h1>What is this?</h1>
			<article>
				This is an experimental, pen-and-paper Roleplaying Game (RPG) System.  It is designed to be lightweight and quick, requiring little fore-knowledge on the playerâ€™s part, allowing for sessions to start sooner and require less preparation time.

  		<h1>What if don't know what an RPG is?</h1>
			<article>
				An RPG is both a form of group storytelling and simulation. A Game Master presents the players with a world full of characters and interesting things to interact with. The other players create characters through which they interact with this world and pursue goals. The game system is then the agreed upon rules by which the characters may interact with the presented world, giving success or failure meaning.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Think of it like a "What if... ?" game where there are actually methods to determine how things play out.

  		<h1>How does this system accomplish that?</h1>
			<article>
				Primarily by restricting the complexity of systems, and giving the Game Master tools to quickly determine results of spontaneous player decisions. Where complex systems do improve player enjoyment, those systems are built to be consistent, so that players can learn a small amount of information and do a lot with it.

  		<h1>Can this system facilitate complex character builds?</h1>
			<article>
				Narratively, yes. This system's goal is to give players the tools to make interesting and strongly defined characters. It does, however, actively attempt to reduce power gaming. The player shouldn't need to study the rules in order to make a powerful character. A character's strengths and weaknesses are intended to be clearly defined from the outset of a game.
