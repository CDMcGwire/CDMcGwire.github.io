				<h2>The Goal</h2>
				<p> The goal of the game can be anything. The Game Master (GM) will present a scenario, insert your characters into the game world (often represented on a tiled board), and then serve as the controller of the Non-player characters (NPCs) of the world that the Player Characters (PCs) interact with in an attempt to achieve player determined goals.</p>
				<p>It is generally the job of the GM to present a scenario that is narratively compelling enough for the players to come up with their own goals.</p>
				<p>It is also perfectly reasonable for players to just want to bash in some skulls and loot dungeons. </p>
