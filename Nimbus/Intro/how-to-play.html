					<summary>The Goal</summary>

					<p> The goal of the game can be anything. The Game Master (<strong>GM</strong>) will present a scenario, insert your characters into the game world (often represented on a tiled board), and then serve as the controller of the Non-player characters (<strong>NPCs</strong>) of the world that the Player Characters (<strong>PCs</strong>) interact with in an attempt to achieve player determined goals.</p>

					<p>It is generally the job of the GM to present a scenario that is narratively compelling enough for the players to come up with their own goals.</p>

					<p>It is also perfectly reasonable for players to just want to bash in some skulls and loot dungeons. </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Your Character</summary>

					<p>Your agent for operating within the game. Each person in the group who is not the GM typically controls one character, the GM controls all of the NPCs, whether they be friend or foe to the players. In this way, it is the GM’s goal to be mostly Neutral to the actions of the players. But more importantly it the GM’s job to make the scenario/adventure fun for everyone who is actually participating. The GM’s responsibilities will be explained in a separate section.</p>

					<p>Making a character is like any dreaming or fiction writing. Your character can be like you, or someone very different than you. Maybe some historical figure you’d like to drop into some imagined scenario. Whatever you think will be fun to play as in whatever fictional world your Game Master provides. Although, note that some GMs will have opinions on just what you can get away with.</p>

					<p>You will then solidify this character into the game rules by picking <strong>Traits</strong> and <strong>Proficiencies</strong>. These things will determine your success at various actions you perform in the game through means of dice rolls!</p>
				</details>

					<summary>Making Rolls</summary>

					<p>Dice are what make RPGs exciting! They represent forces outside the players' and GM's control. That wonderful random circumstances that spice up life and forces us to stay on our toes. When performing any action in which success is not guaranteed (which is a great many actions for adventurous types in hazardous environments, or in precarious social interactions), your character’s success is determined by rolling various dice.</p>

					<p>Menial tasks, like opening a door, usually do not qualify for a dice roll. However, a locked door would qualify for an attempt at picking said lock. A character’s chance at success would then be determined by the player’s “Lockpicking” proficiency (explained later) combined with a die roll which is then pitted against the GM determined difficulty for the lock. If it’s a success, the door is unlocked. If it fails, the door stays locked and a different means of entering will have to be attempted.</p>

					<p>There are dice of multiple sizes. A standard six-sided die is written as a “d6” (die + number of sides), the fancy twenty-sided die you’ll need and will be rolling for the majority of actions is written as “d20”, and so on. Several dice rolled at once is written in the form “3d6” (number of dice + d + number of sides per die). So, if the rules say roll 20d4, you would roll twenty, four-sided dice (This might sound like an unlikely scenario, but high level magic missles can be like that).</p>

					<p>The result of a dice roll can receive bonuses from the aforementioned Traits and Proficiencies, affecting your chance of success. Other elements of the game, such as the difficulty of a task, can apply penalties. This process will be the following sections.</p>

					<h3>Making d20 Rolls</h3>

					<p><strong>This is the main mechanic of the game!</strong></p>

					<p>To determine success or failure when performing some action, the GM will ask you to roll a d20.</p>

					<ul class="emphasized-list">
						<li>A result of 5 or lower is a <strong>Failure</strong></li>
						<li>A result of 6-9 is a <strong>Partial Success</strong></li>
						<li>A result of 10-16 is a <strong>Success</strong></li>
						<li>A result of 17 or higher is a <strong>Great Success</strong></li>
					</ul>

					<p>What exactly each category of success entails changes varies, but generally: Failure means things will proceed as if the rolling character took no action. Partial success will mean the action worked, but with some type of drawback. A standard success means things went as expected. A very successful action will come with some kind of bonus.</p>

					<h3>Critical Success and Failure</h3>

					<p>A <strong>Natural roll</strong> of 20 (just the value of the dice, before bonuses) will result in a <strong>Critical Success</strong> for the player, regardless of the result after bonuses and penalties. This represents an action that, whether it be defying all odds or through sheer overwhelming skill, is absurdly successful. Where the bonus of a critical success are not writen in the rules, the GM should come up with some satisfying result for the player, fit for the task they attempted.</p>

					<p>Likewise, a <strong>Natural Roll</strong> of 1 results in a critical failure for the roller. This represents some action going horrifically wrong, even if it should have been a near guranteed success. The results of a critical failure are rarely set in the rules, but generally the GM should come up with some sort of way for the action to backfire, which can result in further rolls to recover.</p>

					<h3>Bonuses and Penalties</h3>

					<p>As mentioned, various factors (mainly Traits and Proficiencies) will add a bonus to a roll. These bonuses are numbers (like +4). You simply add them to result of the dice roll right before determining success. Penalties are, of course, when some value is subtracted from the total. Multiple bonuses and penalties can apply at the same time.</p>
