				<h2>Attribute Bonuses</h2>
				<p>There are a few common rolls that are based on specific attributes. Those are referenced here. But otherwise, specific rules will explain themselves.</p>
				
				<h3>Health</h3>
				<p>Your starting health is equal to <strong>12 + (2 x Brawn Bonus)</strong></p>
				
				<h2>Determining Your Attributes</h2>
				<ul class="wordy-list">
					<li>All stats begin at 0</li>
					<li>You may then assign 5 points</li>
					<li>Each point spent is a +1 bonus to any rolls made with that attribute</li>
					<li>You can take away 1 point from any attribute to gain an extra point in another attribute</li>
					<li>An attribute may not start lower than -4</li>
					<li>An attribute may not start higher than +4</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Attributes may of course pass the initial limits through leveling or other in-game events.</p>
				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> While a +8 is very large bonus, a -6 to an attribute can often leave your character to be very vulnerable in a variety of situations. A -2, however, is often worth taking to reinforce a particular strength, as the penalty is small enough that it won’t be a huge weakness, and party members can make up for what you lack in that area.</p>
