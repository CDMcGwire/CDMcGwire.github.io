				<h2>Selecting Traits</h2>
				
				<p>There are two main types of traits. <strong>Character Traits</strong>, which you pick when you first create the character. And <strong>Heroic Traits</strong> which your character gains as they adventure and gain experience.</p>

					<summary>Character Traits</summary>
					
					<h3>Backstabber</h3>
					<p>You consider the best way to win a fight is to win before it starts. Whether in the name of survival, efficiency, or what have you, you feel no shame in killing people in their sleep, poisoning their wine, or switching allegiances. You find direct conflict much less favorable, however.</p>
					<p><strong>Bonus: </strong>You add an extra d6 to your damage when attacking a flanked or unaware target. You get a +2 bonus to mixing and identifying poisons.</p>
					<p><strong>Drawback: </strong>Your weapons do not get an attribute modifier for damage when attacking an aware, non-flanked enemy.</p>
					
					<h3>Military Type</h3>
					<p>You've been trained in the tactics and skills necessary for warfare. You know which end of your weapon to hold and, more importantly, how to stay away from the enemy's weapons. However, you didn't have much time to develop skills that weren't immediately important to your commander.</p>
					<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> All weapon proficiencies start at "Proficient"; your character gains 4 extra health; Survival proficiencies get a +2 bonus.</p>
					<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> You may only start with 2 non-combat proficiency points.</p>
					
					<h3>Sea Legs</h3>
					<p>Large bodies of water speak of home to you. You know your way around a ship, swimming is second nature, and you can keep upright in a storm. You aren't quite so comfortable away from the sea, and the thin air of mountains, in particular, puts you down quick.</p>
					<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Your character receives a +5 bonus when attempting ship or water related activities; Your character can hold their breath twice as long as a one with equal brawn.</p>
					<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You suffer from altitude sickness more intensely than the average person. If higher than 2000 feet, you suffer -1 to Agility. At 4000 feet, you also suffer a -1 to Brawn. At 6000 feet or higher, you must make Brawn checks to avoid passing out.</p>
					
					<h3>Sneaky Bastard</h3>
					<p>You’re the type of person who’s always just out of sight. You walk a bit softer than the rest, blend in everywhere you go, and deceive without regret. However, you are rather off-putting to most common folk and nobles. </p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> When you would normally be surprised, you instead get a reactionary chance to roll stealth. You also gain a +2 bonus to Deception rolls.</p>
					<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You are less likely to receive aid from strangers and nobles are more likely to have a guard watch you... If they see you at all.</p>
					
					<h3>Wild Magic</h3>
					<p>Something about you causes any magic effecting you to have a touch of unpredictability. Whether it goes in your favor or brings your undoing, it's bound to be exciting.</p>
					<p><em><strong>NOTE: </strong>This is a trait for people who really like rolling dice. Some effects can cause a cascade of differenct rolls. As such, this trait has <a href="../Magic/wild-magic.html">a dedicated page</a> explaining how it works.</em></p>
