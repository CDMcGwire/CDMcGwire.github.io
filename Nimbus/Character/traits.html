				<h2>Selecting Traits</h2>
				
				<p>There are two main types of traits. <strong>Character Traits</strong>, which you pick when you first create the character. And <strong>Heroic Traits</strong> which your character gains as they adventure and gain experience.</p>
				<p>When creating your character, you may pick two Character Traits. These are optional.</p>
				<p>As you level up, you gain Heroic traits. These are still intended to hone in on a specific playstyle and are thus optional, but are generally a bigger boost than Character traits.</p>

					<summary>Character Traits</summary>
					<!-- Need some more... bright traits. -->
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Adaptable</summary>
						<p>You don't <em>come</em> prepared for everything, but, by the end of things, you're something of a minor expert in whatever it was you were doing. You're plenty able to leave the past behind to live well in the here and now.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> When you level up, you may reallocate one proficiency point of both types. <em>For example, if you had 2 points in axes, and 3 points in persuasion, you could reduce axes to 1 and bring spears to 1, and reduce persuasion to 2 and put that point into devices.</em> You also gain an extra proficiency point every other level starting at level 2.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You start with only 1 combat proficiency point and no non-combat proficiency points. This overrides any other trait that changes how many points you start with, but not traits which affect specfic proficiencies directly.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Backstabber</summary>
						<p>You consider the best way to win a fight is to win before it starts. Whether in the name of survival, efficiency, or what have you, you feel no shame in killing people in their sleep, poisoning their wine, or switching allegiances. You find direct conflict much less favorable, however.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus: </strong>You add an extra d6 to your damage when attacking a flanked or unaware target. You get a +2 bonus to mixing and identifying poisons.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawback: </strong>Your weapons do not get an attribute modifier for damage when attacking an aware, non-flanked enemy.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Conduit</summary>
						<p>Arcane energies course through you like a lightning rod. You've learned how to tap in to it when your natural power is not enough. Carelessness, however, could leave you burned by the overflow.</p>
						<details>
							<summary class="minor-collapsible">Effect:</summary>
							<p>When making a physical damage roll or rolling for a spell effect, you may choose to attempt to harness Arcane power to assist the roll. To do so, roll a d20, on an 11 or higher you may add 1d6 to the triggering roll. If the result is 10 or less, you are instead burned for 1d6 damage. On a natural 20, </p>
						</details>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Cursed</summary>
						<p>Through some doomed act of bravery or foolish endeavor, you ended up cursed. Curses can come in several variations. If you choose this trait, select a single curse from the <a href="../Adventuring Aid/curses.html">Curses</a> page. The Curse remains until you go through some sort of ritual to remove.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Farmer's Child</summary>
						<p>Working the field has been your life up until recently. As a result, you're a hearty and handy person. Albeit lacking some experience in the areas of life beyond the field.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> You begin the game with 4 extra hit-points. You receive a +2 to any non-combat roll involving simple tools or plant knowledge. You also get an automatic 20% off any produce you buy, which you may then barter lower if you so choose.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You suffer a -4 to any knowledge rolls involving city life, politics, or the arcane. And you find yourself unable to use all but the simplest of magical tools. You are unable to train in the School of Illusion.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">From the Frosted Lands</summary>
						<p>You hail from a region of long Winters. What most consider bitter cold, you consider a warm memory of home. You know how to thrive in frozen environments and generally handle a chill better than most. However, you find it difficult to operate in warmer climates.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> You suffer no penalties to survival skills due to snow or ice and only the harshest of cold climates has an effect on your base stats. Also, any damage resulting from cold is reduced by 5 to a minimum of zero.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Your Intellect and Perception suffer a -1 penalty when in harsh sunlight for more than an hour. You also sunburn easily.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Haunted One</summary>
						<p>You've seen things that have left scars in your mind. You may even be the subject of torment by some supernatural being. Whatever it is that haunts you, it's left you more attuned to the parts of the world which lie outside normal perception. Just pray your sanity remains in check.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> You have an innate ability to see apparitions and can tell when someone is possessed. You also gain a +3 bonus when attempting to detect magic.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You must pass a Perception roll in order to concentrate when speaking to people. What exactly failure looks like in a situation is up to you as the player, but you can not communicate the intended piece of information. You can be shook back into reality by someone else.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Loner</summary>
						<p>You're the type that tends to go it alone. Whether it's due to a lack of trust in other intelligent beings, or simply because you're stuck in your own world. The good thing is, you've gotten accustomed to operating with little to no people around and can do a lot by yourself. The bad thing is, you have a harder time working in groups.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> You gain 2 extra non-combat proficiencies but they may not be spent on a Social proficiency. Somehow, you're able to accomplish simple, two-man jobs by yourself.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> You suffer a -2 penalty when attempting to Persuade or Charm. NPCs tend to ignore you in Social situations.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Military Type</summary>
						<p>You've been trained in the tactics and skills necessary for warfare. You know which end of your weapon to hold and, more importantly, how to stay away from the enemy's weapons. However, you didn't have much time to develop skills that weren't immediately important to your commander.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> All weapon proficiencies start at "Proficient"; your character gains 4 extra health; Survival proficiencies get a +2 bonus.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> You may only start with 2 non-combat proficiency points.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Pyromaniac</summary>
						<p>Fire and explosions define your life. You tolerate heat much better than the average person and you can spark a flame from less than ideal materials. If things aren't burning, you get antsy... and maybe a touch angry. You're not necessarily insane, you just need the excitement.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Anytime you would roll to start a fire, whether magically or naturally, double the chance of ignition. Your fires last 50% longer, spread twice as fast, and deal an extra 1d4 damage to creatures caught in the flames.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> Whenever you are near flammables, there is a 5% chance (with doubling) you'll accidently set something on fire. When using the Devices skill, a natural 1 is guaranteed to <a href="../Adventuring Aid/fire-and-explosions.html">cause the device to explode</a>.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Sea Legs</summary>
						<p>Large bodies of water speak of home to you. You know your way around a ship, swimming is second nature, and you can keep upright in a storm. You aren't quite so comfortable away from the sea, and the thin air of mountains, in particular, puts you down quick.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Your character receives a +5 bonus when attempting ship or water related activities; Your character can hold their breath twice as long as a one with equal brawn.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You suffer from altitude sickness more intensely than the average person. If higher than 2000 feet, you suffer -1 to Agility. At 4000 feet, you also suffer a -1 to Brawn. At 6000 feet or higher, you must make Brawn checks to avoid passing out.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Sneaky Bastard</summary>
						<p>You’re the type of person who’s always just out of sight. You walk a bit softer than the rest, blend in everywhere you go, and deceive without regret. However, you are rather off-putting to most common folk and nobles. </p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> When you would normally be surprised, you instead get a reactionary chance to roll stealth. You also gain a +2 bonus to Deception rolls.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You are less likely to receive aid from strangers and nobles are more likely to have a guard watch you... If they see you at all.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Socialite</summary>
						<p>You're the quintessential party goer. Small talk comes easy, you can please a crowd, and you know how to get into the good graces of the movers and shakers in society. You might rely on other people a little too much, but that's a small problem to you.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> All Social skills, except intimidation, start with one rank of proficiency and you can immediately pick out the important people in a crowd.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You start with only 2 combat and 2 non-combat proficiency points. You also suffer a -1 penalty to intellect when alone.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Spirtually Centered</summary>
						<p>You've made peace with the existential. Experiences that would leave many as hollow souls, you take in stride. This attunement has cut you off from the world of the dark arts, for good and ill.</p>
						<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You are uneffected by all but the most powerful of rituals and curses. Likewise, you can not benefit from any ritual or curse, no matter how powerful.</p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Wild Magic</summary>
						<p>Something about you causes any magic effecting you to have a touch of unpredictability. Whether it goes in your favor or brings your undoing, it's bound to be exciting.</p>
						<p><em><strong>NOTE: </strong>This is a trait for people who really like rolling dice. Some effects can cause a cascade of differenct rolls. As such, this trait has <a href="../Magic/wild-magic.html">a dedicated page</a> explaining how it works.</em></p>
					</details>
					
					<details>
						<summary class="inner-summary">Workaholic</summary>
						<p>You live to work, and you enjoy it. In fact, when you set your mind to something, you usually do it better than most. Unfortunately you're not quite sure when to stop, or you may just not want to.</p>
						<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> When using a mechanical skill, the quality of the resulting item is doubled. When performing grunt labor, you accomplish 50% more.</p>
						<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> It takes you twice as long to use mechanical skills, and you always work 1d4 hours longer than you should for other tasks, unless forced to stop.</p>
