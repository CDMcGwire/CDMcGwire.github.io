					<summary>Overview</summary>

					<p>A player's character consists of ruled and narrative components.</p>

					<p>Ruled components include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Attributes</li>
						<li>Traits</li>
						<li>Proficiencies</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Narrative components include things like:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Age</li>
						<li>Appearance</li>
						<li>Personality</li>
						<li>Style</li>
						<li>Eye color?</li>
						<li>Any other lore or cosmetic details</li>
					</ul>

					<p>There is no set order you need to make these choices in. But you fill find that some decisions will flow naturally from others. Try to find the central defining traits of what you want to play as, then define the components from there.</p>

				<h2>Attributes</h2>
				
				<p>Attributes are a list of numbers that represent your character’s base physical, mental, and spiritual traits. If an action requires a roll that isn’t covered by a specific skill, it will be based on an attribute. Several important stats are based directly on attributes, like health and natural defense.</p>
				<p>The attributes are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Agility</li>
					<li>Brawn</li>
					<li>Charisma</li>
					<li>Intellect</li>
					<li>Perception</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Proficiencies</h2>
				
				<p>Proficiencies describe your character's trained skills. These may be modified by Traits, but differ in that they develop over time. Examples include the character's skill with a spear, lockpicking, and/or magic.</p>

				<h2>Traits</h2>
				<p>Traits are an optional aspect of character creation. They are intended to give players a way to tweak the rules to support a specific playstyle. They work on a give and take system, for every bonus there is a drawback, and are thus not required. They are often more benefit than penalty, but can be very situational.</p>
				<p>As an example, the "Military Type" trait gives the player base proficiency with all weapon types, but they start with only two non-combat proficiencies.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Narrative Components</h2>
				
				<p>These are things like name, age, style, which don't directly affect any of the mechanics of the game. But they do help define your character, thus how the world will respond to your character. They make the game more flavorful and memorable for everyone involved and can inspire you to make desicions in game in a way you normally wouldn't. Which, of course, can lead to unexpected results!</p>
				
				<p>It's the difference between playing as some guy named James who hits things with his sword versus playing as Sir Bedivere von Biddles, the Righteous Paladin who brings his blind sense of Justice to the world through his mighty battleaxe.</p>
