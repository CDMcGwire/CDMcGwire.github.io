				<h1>Combat Proficiencies</h1>
				<main>Problem solving <em>with</em> weapons</main>

			<section>
				<p>Combat proficiencies progress differently than non-combat, but are more nuanced. Training Combat proficiencies provides a few more bonuses than just chance to hit. Such as damage and attacks per turn. It is suggested that you read the basic rules of combat before deciding on your combat proficiencies.</p>
				<p>Proficiency points in weapon types are applied on a category by category basis. For instance, one point in axes will take you from “no proficiency” to “proficient”. And this bonus applies to all weapons that can be placed under that category. Even more exotic designs.</p>
				<p>As a reminder, you start the game with <strong>2 combat proficiency points</strong>. Unless a trait says otherwise. More are gained as you level.</p>
				
				<h3>Example</h3>
				<p>If you want your character to be great with longswords, you would spend combat proficiency points into the "Long Blades" category of weapons. At two points, your character would be "Experienced", and thus you would receive a +2 on your rolls to hit opponents.</p>

					<summary>Heavy Armor</summary>
					<p>Heavy armors provide massive defense from conventional attacks and do not require proficiency for the user to gain protection from them, but proficiency can reduce the movement penalties for wearing heavy armor.</p>
					<p><strong>The base movement penalties from heavy armor are thus</strong>: -4 to Agility based rolls; -5 feet to base move speed; any stealth roll receives a -10.</p>
					<h3>Proficiency Ranks</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>No Proficiency</strong>: Penalties as stated above</li>
						<li><strong>Proficient</strong>: Agility penalty reduced to -3</li>
						<li><strong>Experienced</strong>: Agility penalty reduced to -2; No movement penalty</li>
						<li><strong>Expert</strong>: Agility penalty reduced to -1</li>
						<li><strong>Mastered</strong>: No penalty to Agility</li>
					</ul>
					<p>NOTE: The stealth penalty will always be -10 unless the armor itself is crafted to reduce noise/weight.</p>

				<details>
					<summary>Magic</summary>
					<p>Magic works a bit differently from other proficiencies, but is trained in the same manner. One need not be a dedicated “Wizard” to cast spells, but proficiency ranks must be put into a school of spells to cast magic of that type. Each school gains proficiency ranks separately. As proficiency is increased, the complexity of spells and number of casts increases. </p>
					<p>There is one other common limit to magic. The caliber of spell one may cast is determined by the Intellect attribute. The following list states the requirements. </p>
					<h3>Proficiency Ranks</h3>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<li><strong>No Proficiency</strong>: Cannot cast spells from this school</li>
						<li><strong>Dabbler</strong>: May cast basic forms of spells from the chosen school; Requires a Knowledge of +1</li>
						<li><strong>Novice</strong>: May cast Second Rank spell forms from the chosen school; Requires a Knowledge of +2</li>
						<li><strong>Competent</strong>: May cast Third Rank spell forms from the chosen school; Requires a Knowledge of +3</li>
						<li><strong>Adept</strong>: May cast Fourth ranks spell forms from the chosen school; Requires a Knowledge of +4</li>
						<li><strong>Expert</strong>: May cast Fifth rank spell forms from the chosen school; Requires a Knowledge of +5</li>
						<li><strong>Master</strong>: May cast 6th rank spell forms from the chosen school; Requires a Knowledge of +6</li>
						<li><strong>Ascended</strong>: May cast Ascended forms from the chosen school; Requires a Knowledge of +7</li>
					</ul>
