				<p>Race in Nimbus, as with most RPGs, is a question of what kind of sentient creature you are. All of the playable races given here are humanoids and share the most essential bipedal traits, like arms, legs, heads, and the ability to speak and reason like a human (but not always <em>exactly</em> like one).</p>

				<h2>Playable Races</h2>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Human</summary>
					<p>Extraordinarily ordinary. This game is balanced around humans, and as such they have no extra bonuses or drawbacks that are not simply a part of the game already.</p>
					<p>This makes humans a great choice for players who like a well rounded and adaptable character! One who doesn't make extreme sacrifices in one set of skills to hone in on another.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Dwarf</summary>
					<p>Dwarves are a short but hearty race that finds their home in sprawling underground kingdoms. They are lords of the stones they live among, with mining, smithing, masonry, and gemwork being highly esteemed roles in their society.</p>
					<p>Dwarves share the same base physical traits as humans, but are significantly shorter and more sturdily built. Male dwarves are also very fond of their enormous beards which they groom meticulously.</p>
					<p>Dwarves are among the most out of touch with the world of the Arcane. While not incapable of casting spells, it takes a great deal of effort and is generally seen as a waste of time and effort. They value the work of the hand too highly to pursue such things.</p>
					<p>Dwarves half twice the lifespan of the average human. They are also tougher than surface folk, with a natural tolerance to many weak poisons and the ability to take more physical damage before going down.</p>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Bonuses:</strong>
						<li>Dwarves start with +1 Brawn and a starting maximum of +5 and a minimum of -3.</li>
						<li>Dwarves gain extra hit-points at first level equal to their Brawn bonus.</li>
						<li>Dwarves do not lose their sense of direction underground.</li>
						<li>Dwarves can immediately identify all but the rarest metals and minerals, and anything they craft or forge is a notch higher quality than a workman of equal experience.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Drawbacks:</strong>
						<li>Dwarves may not start with an intellect greater than +3.</li>
						<li>Dwarves require 2 points to gain a rank of proficiency in Magic.</li>
						<li>The base movement speed for a dwarf is 25 feet.</li>
						<li>For the first hour in sunlight, after emerging from a dark or dim environmnet, Dwarves suffer a -1 penalty to perception.</li>
					</ul>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Elf</summary>
					<p>The elves are a race which has become innately attuned to the world of the Arcane. So much so, that they find the non-destructive forms of magic indistinguishable from nature. Their art and architecture reflect this as plants and magic are interwoven to form various structures and statues.</p>
					<p>Physically, elves are nearly indistinguishable from humans. Yet their pointed ears and otherworldly beauty betray their origin. The average elf is slim, with a fair facial complexion.</p>
					<p>Intellectual pursuits and an appreciation for the innate beauty of the world are what define elven culture. They have little patience for brash decision making and abhor any pursuit that sacrifices grace for utility.</p>
					<p>It should also be noted that elves are very long lived. Most can live to about one thousand years, though the most powerful often live even longer. Because of this elongated lifespan, most elves exhibit a great deal of finesse, as they have had much time to develop their skills. Elves can speak their own language as well as common human languages.</p>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Bonuses:</strong>
						<li>Elves start with a +1 in Intellect and Perception with a max starting value of +5 and a minimum of -3.</li>
						<li>Elves begin with 1 extra combat proficiency in a spell School of their choice.</li>
						<li>Elves have keen vision, allowing them to navigate in darkness as though it were a dimly lit room. They also suffer no penalties to perception in darkness within 60 feet.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Drawbacks:</strong>
						<li>Elves may only start with weapon proficiencies in short or long blades, bows, or spears. This can be overriden by traits.</li>
						<li>Elves are unable to start with non-combat proficiencies in Street Wisdom.</li>
						<li>City and Underground environments wear on Elves' souls. After being in either location for a day, the suffer a -1 penalty to perception.</li>
						<li>Being cut off from magic is nearly a death sentence for elves, causing a -2 penalty to all attributes.</li>
					</ul>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Half-elf</summary>
					<p>The child of a human and an elf, a half does not quite have all the innate abilities of an elf, but they also share even less of the weaknesses. They get a noticeable amount of their physical traits from the elven parent, and share half the lifespan.</p>
					<p>Half-elves are prone to have many different backgrounds, and are thus very adaptable, as per their human origin.</p>
					
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Bonuses:</strong>
						<li>Half-elves are able to start with a max Intellect and Perception of +5.</li>
						<li>Half-elves get one free rank in a Magic proficiency of their choice.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Drawbacks:</strong>
						<li>Half-elves suffer a -2 to Intellect when cut off from magic.</li>
					</ul>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Half-orc</summary>
					<p>The child of a human and an orc, half-orcs inherit some of the raw strength and aggression of their orc parent. Due to their human ancestry, they are much more clever and significantly more agile than their brutish kin. Rare and despised by many, most wander the land earning their keep as hired muscle.</p>
					<p>Slightly taller than the average human, half-orcs have green skin, broad and bulky builds, and a somewhat neanderthal shaped head. They are capable of living about as long as most humans, but most find it preferable to live a short glorious life.</p>
					<p>Half-orcs that do make it into the later years slow down and go through a long period of reclusiveness. After which, they are often known to become determined and successful warlords. However, it truly is rare for one to live long enough to reach this age.</p>
					
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Bonuses:</strong>
						<li>Half-orcs start with a Brawn of +2 with a max starting bonus of +5 and minimum of -3.</li>
						<li>Half-orcs start with a +2 in the Threaten proficiency.</li>
						<li>Half-orcs heal faster than humans, regaining 75% of the health they lost after a battle. They only require an hour of rest to regain all of their hit-points, and they can get back into a fight immediately upon returning to a positive health value.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Drawbacks:</strong>
						<li>Half-orcs may only start with a max Intellect bonus of +2 and may reach a minimum of -5.</li>

					</ul>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Dragonborn</summary>
					<p>Dragonborn are a race of reptilian humanoids that share blood with true dragons. As a culture, they embody the traits of their greater brethren, but to a more mild extent. They are a mostly reclusive people that prioritize the accumulation of wealth and territory. They produce very little themselves, only what is essential, and their buildings and art are usually taken from some other civilization. Either through conquest or claiming what was abandoned.</p>
					<p>With the head of a strong, proud reptile, steely scales, long tails, and clawed, beastly limbs, Dragonborn have an immediate resemblance to their ancient kin. Their scales come in a great variety of colors. Those with bright red scales are held in high regard as warriors.</p>
					<p>They are very individualistic, and most of their day to day tasks are carried out independently. Within tribes, leaders are chosen by demonstrated strength and cunning, but a tribe may go without any formal authority figure for years, electing one only in the face of crisis or the need to conquer new territory.</p>
					<p>Dragonborn speak the language of dragons and do so primarily, but they are very capable of learning other languages. A skill they use to intimidate and exalt themselves to their neighboring cultures.</p>
					
					<h3>Elemental Affinity</h3>
					<p>Dragonborn are born attuned to either fire or ice. Whichever element they are attuned to, they take 5 less damage from and can breath out as an attack. They take 1d4 + 1 extra damage from the other element. The stats for a breath attack are as follows:</p>
					<p><strong>1d8 + Brawn <a href="../Combat/attacking-and-defense.html#splash-damage">Splash damage</a> in a 45 degree cone extending 20 feet out from the attacker.</strong></p>
					
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Bonuses:</strong>
						<li>Dragonborn start with a Brawn of +2 with a maximum of +5 and a minimum of 0.</li>
						<li>Dragonborn have a natural +1 to armor on account of their scales.</li>
						<li>An unarmed attack from a Dragonborn deals an extra 1d4 damage.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Drawbacks:</strong>
						<li>A Dragonborn must pass an Intellect roll to ignore a challenge. Any successful attempt to intimidate a Dragonborn is seen as a challenge to a duel.</li>
						<li>Attempts to Charm a Dragonborn using awe and praise gain a +2 bonus.</li>
						<li>Dragonborn are unable to train Crafting, Smithing, or Bartering.</li>
