				<p>Race in Nimbus, as with most RPGs, is a question of what kind of sentient creature you are. All of the playable races given here are humanoids and share the most essential bipedal traits, like arms, legs, heads, and the ability to speak and reason like a human (but not always <em>exactly</em> like one).</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>The playable races are listed here:</p>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Human</summary>
					<p>Extraordinarily ordinary. This game is balanced around humans, and as such they have no extra bonuses or drawbacks that are not simply a part of the game already.</p>
					<p>This makes humans a great choice for players who like a well rounded and adaptable character! One who doesn't make extreme sacrifices in one set of skills to hone in on another.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Elf</summary>
					<p>The elves are a race which has become innately attuned to the world of the Arcane. So much so, that they find the non-destructive forms of magic indistinguishable from nature. Their art and architecture reflect this as plants and magic are interwoven to form various structures and statues.</p>
					<p>Physically, elves are nearly indistinguishable from humans. Yet their pointed ears and otherworldly beauty betray their origin. The average elf is slim, with a fair facial complexion.</p>
					<p>Intellectual pursuits and an appreciation for the innate beauty of the world are what define elven culture. They have little patience for brash decision making and abhor any pursuit that sacrifices grace for utility.</p>
					<p>It should also be noted that elves are very long lived. Most can live to about one thousand years, though the most powerful often live even longer. Because of this elongated lifespan, most elves exhibit a great deal of finesse, as they have had much time to develop their skills.</p>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<strong>Bonuses:</strong>
						<li>Elves start with a +1 in Intellect with a max starting value of +5 and a minimum of -3.</li>
						<li>Elves begin with 1 extra combat proficiency in a spell School of your choice.</li>
						<li></li>
					</ul>
