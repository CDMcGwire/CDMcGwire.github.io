				<h1>Creating a Character</h1>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Character Details</h2>
				<p>The details that should be filled out for each character are:</p>
				<ul class="wordy-list">
					<li>Name</li>
					<li><strong>Main personality trait:</strong> Something about the way your character talks, behaves, and/or looks which makes them standout and likeable.</li>
					<li><strong>Main personality flaw:</strong> Something about the way your character talks, behaves, and/or looks which tends to rub some people the wrong way and gets them in trouble.</li>
					<li><strong>Life Goal:</strong> The thing your character strives for and ultimately directs all their resources and planning towards.</li>
					<li><strong>Conflicting Goal:</strong> An unchecked desire or habit that complicates your character's plans.</li>
					<li><strong>Trained skills: </strong>Techincal actions and tasks your character excels at. Such as cooking, shooting a bow, or talking down criminals.</li>
					<li><strong>Technical Shortcomings: </strong>Techincal actions and tasks your character has a very difficult time with or just can't do. Such as always always leaving the kitchen a mess, being unable to aim a gun, or stumbling over your words when talking to royalty.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>GM Notes: </strong>It is suggested that you have the players go through each detail one at a time, as a group. For instance, everyone takes turns comming up with and announcing their main personality trait, then everyone takes turns with their flaws, and so on. Players should be encouraged to comment on other's ideas and give suggestions, as long as they're being respectful.</p>
				<p>As the GM, it'll be your job to help players flesh out their ideas, and make sure that they make sense within the context of the setting and the mood of the group as a whole. </p>

				<h2>Character Abilities</h2>
				<p>The final aspect of character creation is coming up with character abilities. These are 'Ace in the Sleeve' type actions that are very specific, but the character can always perform them without a check (so long as they are physically capable of doing so).</p>
				<p>Players come up with their abilities on the spot, with the only rule being that the GM must be okay with it. They can be as useful or silly as the player can imagine, but a good GM should reject ideas that are uncreatively powerful. Good abilities that add to the fun and narrative game create opportunities, but don't always solve problems on their own. Bad abilities do more than one thing, are vaguely defined, and resolve situations anti-climatically.</p>
				<p><strong>Good Examples: </strong>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<li><em>"Everytime my character winks at someone, that person throws up."</em><br/>
							This ability works because, while it's almost magical in how it works, there is a simple way to explain it, it can be used to solve problems, and it can also cause problems in the wrong situations.</li>
						<li><em>"I can paint a flawless portrait of anyone."</em><br/>
							This is a good ability because it's very specific and powerful, but its usefullness depends on the context and creativity of the player.</li>
						<li><em>"I always shoot first." </em><br/>
							This type of ability works because, while is somewhat vague, it creates a very distinct behaviour pattern for the character and the GM can easily add a few conditions to make it fit the setting. It also doesn't gurantee the shot will <em>succeed</em> just that it will happen before anything else.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Bad Examples: </strong>
					<ul class="wordy-list">
						<li><em>"I can travel through time at will."</em><br/>
							Unless playing a setting that specifically expects time travellers and super powers, this character will end up solving every problem by brushing it away under 'Time travel solved it.'</li>
						<li><em>"I can recreate any painting perfectly, even if I've never seen it."</em><br/>
							This doesn't work because it has unexplainable methods purely for the sake of working around its natural limitations. Simply removing the 'never seen it' part would make this a fine ability.</li>
						<li><em>"I can kill everyone I see before they can react." </em><br/>
							This is a poor ability in 99% of scenarios because it is simply too powerful and has no interesting interactions unless every other character and NPC is equally powerful.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p><strong>GM Note: </strong>If a player gives an ability that is too vague or powerful, don't just shut it down, try to suggest conditions and details that would make it work. The player will either enjoy the suggestions and add them, or they'll make come up with something else as they decide that the idea isn't as great as they thought.</p>
