				<h2>Picking A Setting</h2>
				<p>Any setting can be picked so long as the players and GM feel that they understand it well enough to act within it. Whether it be historical reenactments, political satires, bank heists, standard fantasy fare, or even Space Jam, as long as you can imagine how that world can work and react, you can use it.</p>
				<p>If, as a GM, you pick a setting, and suddenly realize you don't understand it, just start making things up. Let the players in on it too. If you know what they're expecting, you can come up with more interesting encounters on the fly by selectively playing into or circumventing those expectations.</p>

				<h2>Character Creation</h2>
				<p>Character creation in Nimbus involves coming up with a general concept for a character then filling in specific narrative details like goals and skills. It is a group activity and a major part of establishing the mood, setting, and goals of the game. Filling out the narrative details also informs the mechanics of the game. Should a character have an easy or hard time of convincing the king to up the bounty? If the character is a smooth talker, then it should be easy. Meanwhile, a player with a 'strong silent type' character will have to be extra creative or they'll have a hard roll.</p>
				<p>Players may come into the session with a general idea of what their character will be, but the majority of the creation process should happen on the first session of an adventure. The page at the following link explains how the creation process works.</p>

				<h2>Rolls and Difficulty</h2>
				<p>The central gameplay mechanic of Nimbus is rolling a set of dice to determine a whether or not a character's succeeds at a given task. A standard roll uses three six-sided dice. Each side counts as a certain number of 'marks' with 1, 2, or 3 being worth zero marks, 4 and 5 worth one mark, and 6 giving two marks.</p>
				<p>The total of the roll is compared to the difficulty of the task, given as a number of marks needed to succeed. The difficulties are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Easy - one mark - appx. 87% chance of success</li>
					<li>Medium - two marks - appx. 62% chance of success</li>
					<li>Hard - three marks - appx. 32% chance of success</li>
					<li>Very Hard - four marks - appx. 16% chance of success</li>
					<li>Rediculous - five marks - appx. 1.4% chance of success</li>
					<li>Impossible - six marks - appx. 0.5% chance of success</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Player Archetypes</h3>
				<p>As an extra option to change up gameplay, players may select an 'Archetype' for themselves that changes how they roll. These archetypes are independent from the player's character, and are instead an optional meta-game element. The available archetypes are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Planning ahead: </strong> May choose to roll one dice ahead of time and store the result. The other two dice are then rolled when the player decides to make a rollable action.</li>
					<li><strong>Never Tell Me The Odds: </strong> The player relinquishes all dice to the GM. They are never told the probability of success, and the GM may elect to roll one extra dice and either add or subtract the value rolled.</li>
					<li><strong>Gambler's Spirit: </strong> The player always rolls an extra d20 with their normal roll. On a natural 20, they critically succeed any rollable task. On a 1 they critically fail. On a 4 or less, their entire roll fails normally.</li>
					<li><strong>Buying Favors: </strong> May ask the GM for an extra dice on a single roll in exchange for a favor. The GM may use a favor on any of that player's future rolls to take away a dice of the GM's choice.</li>
					<li><strong>Butterfingered Savant: </strong> The player rolls only 2 dice for easy and medium difficulty tasks, but they may roll 4 on rediculous and impossible tasks.</li>
					<li><strong>Bucket Roller: </strong> Rolls 12 dice instead of three, but only sixes count, and are only worth one mark.</li>
				</ul>
